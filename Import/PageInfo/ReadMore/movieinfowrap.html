        <p class="lead text-muted">Here is a list of my top 12+2 favorite movies - and a pattern emerges.<br> With 8 of My favorite Series.</p>

                <input id="collapsible3" class="toggle" type="checkbox">

                        <p class="lead text-muted">One of the questions I get the most - which is most likely out of mere curiosity I believe; is what are my favorite movies. 
                            <br><br> 
                        Many seem to think my top 10 would be about... well I could only imagine due to my ideology. </p>

                        <p class="lead text-muted">Of course topping contenders would be Passion of Christ, Gladiator, Boondock Saints, GreenStreet Hooligans, The Patriot, 300, Law Abiding Citizen, Gangs of New York, or even How to Rob a Bank...
                            <br><br> 
                        I am sure many would guess the Matrix, Equlibrium, Lord of War, V for Vendetta, and others would probably say something like Exam, The Interview(Hugo Weaving one), Faceoff, American Pyscho, Cube, or Saw.
                            <br><br> 
                        All of which are in my collection -- all in which I absolutley do in fact admire - and all for the reasons many would probably never think they would be.</p>

                        <p class="lead text-muted">Out of all the hollywood movies/entertainment - my list always seems to catch everyone off guard.
                            <br><br> 
                        I share them here because they are a big influence and massive personal inspirations that are some of the greatest works in my eyes and because I am surprisingly asked alot.
                            <br><br> 
                        Maybe you haven't seen them and this list presents a chance to watch them, maybe you have seen them and hopefully will have some nostalgic effect. Either way I hope you get something out of them.
                        </p>

                        <p>No particular order - I just moved the cartoons to the top for the sake of some kind of sectionial organization. Keep in mind Hollywood will always try to input degeneracy and perversion to warp fantastic messages.</p>

                        <h3>Show Series</h3>

                        <p class="lead text-muted">This only expands to series where things change a little or shifts in opposition to movies - or at least many tend to think so at first glance.
                            <br><br> 
                        My top 8 in which I catch grief for all the time. Even when seen on my shelf I get the question really?
                            <br><br> 
                        Yes, really. A series is more than a message, more than the general idea as a movie is, it is an explanation - a deep dive into those concepts - a demonstration persay played out in real time(series).
