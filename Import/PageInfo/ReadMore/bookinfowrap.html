        <p class="lead text-muted">This list is cited as a grand overview of varying topics. These books are not hosted here for free to skip purchasing them - but to disseminate crucial knowledge and encourage greater comprehension of the material presented.</p>

        <p class="lead text-muted">I have left out more complex compositions, including some from amazing authors and philosophers because their work surpasses the 9-Neins mission. They deserve to be compensated for their scholarly endeavors; for example

            <a href="https://shop.aer.io/ClemensBlairLLC" target="_dibook">Thomas Dalton</a>, Goodrich, and Michael E Jones are included within this list - they are way too valuable not to be. Support Pro-White authors!</p>

The idea here - is only to give a quick starting point per topic and not a Grand Collection which I feel needs to be discovered on ones own - such as

                <p>Which are widely available. This list is not up for debate or suggestion. It is simply a guide that covers soley the NineNeins mission and a few options/alternatives - nothing more nothing less.</p> 
                <p>I made it as simple as I could to direct titles to their hardcopy versions for reference or purchase. Some Titles will require crypto currency - in which for some titles : Ebay is available for the easiest and fastest ways for available copies and prices  in attempt to avoid the likes of Barnes&Noble, Amazon, etc. By using other mainstream platforms as seldom as possible such as ThriftBooks. This is a fiat dillimea.</p>
                <p>My main effort in this regard was to direct the proceeds of books to the direct authors and publishers where possible - or if not always feasable - then into the hands of smaller, friendlier, and not corporate book shops.
                </p>
                <p>Most non-corporate book shops will require Crypto in which is a double edge sword. It can be a great strength or a great weakness.</p>
