                    Currently Nothing. <strong>NineNeins</strong> which is our Main Development is a game - still in development.

                    Videos are compressed which does not sound like much - but I promise you non-compressed content in pro-White circles is a major bottleneck.<br><br> Videos uploaded by <strong>NineNeins</strong> make for less buffering, faster loads, and easier to actully share with others - with video being selected due to being solid, impactful, focused, inspirational, and information packed.<br> For example such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Omniphi</li>
                        <li>Ares</li>
                        <li>Dennis Wise</li>
                        <li>EmpireFrontier</li>
                        <li>TruthVids</li>
                    </ul>
                    And others creating masterpieces.<br><br>
                    As for the books there is nothing much special about the NineNeins version, but it is great for a virtual library specially for those new to the literature, and conveient for those who are not. Which helps locate physical copies to support pro-White authors. That right there is the biggest reason.<br><br>
                    The Music is more for the Album feel. Complete with Album art work for those like me who appreciate that sort of thing.<br><br>
                    And finally what about the arcade? You didnt even know those games existed enjoy.

                        <br>
                        The number 9 is Holy in nearly every aspect.The main reasons it was adopted into the name are :
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        1. The Ninth Hour is the Hour of Prayer - Jesus died during the Ninth hour, hanging on the cross.<br>
                        
                        2. The Nine Fruits of the Spirit - White Western Civilization.<br>
                        
                        3. The Nine Bows - which proves the Bible account perfect and flawless with Egyptians and Isralites being White.<br>
                       
                        4. 9 in Hebrew is Truth - not in yiddish.<br>
                       
                        5. In Viking times the father had to recognize a newborn child on the Ninth night. <br>The infant was placed on the knee of the father. Water was sprinkled over the baby and the child was given a name.<br>
                        The newborn was now a legal member of the family.<br>
                       
                        6. Beethoven Symphony No. 9 - The melody of the European Anthem.<br>
                      
                        7. Europe Day is May 9th of each year.<br>
                      
                        8. For pagan the tarot card is the hermit - self-examination, reflection, and willingness to seek advice.
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        And Finally, 
                       
                        9. When multiplied number 9 always reproduces itself.</br>
                    <h4 class="tc">Neins</h4> 
                        <br>
                        Moving onto Nein which simply means "No" in German. It is used to address the 9 deadly sins... yes... I said 9
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        I am sure every one is familiar with the 7 = pride, envy, gluttony, greed, lust, sloth, and wrath
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        These are pretty self explanatory - yet even all together are not "Unforgivable" there are however 2 "Unforgiveable" sins that need to be clarified : 
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        Although they are covered by the 7 they need to be clear... due to their Importance!
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        Racemixing(lust & wrath)<br>
                        & <br>
                        Not loving your Race with all your heart(pride, envy, greed, sloth, wrath).
                        <br class="r"><br />
                        
                        Racemixing is "Unforgiveable" as stated clearly in the Scripture - for it is the pollution and creation of an abomination which is murder. 
                        <br class="r"><br /> 

                        Which is nearly identical with not loving your race with all your heart. But an adultrus chasing other gods and their strange flesh abominations. 
                        <br class="r"><br />

                        How can you claim to be Christian and Love Yahweh if you destroy Yahwehs Vine, or do not love Yahwehs creation.  
                        <br class="r"><br />

                        "These 2 rest all the law and the Prophets"-Christ
                        Put them together and wahla Nine Neins! <p class="bh"> Now Nine more Know.
