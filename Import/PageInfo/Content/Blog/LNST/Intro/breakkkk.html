
We reach the next level and an introduction in which I could not figure out out to explain - by breaking it up among topics. This topic is massive and will and critical to give an idea of races as a whole and why they are fundamental to understand.

So this breakdown will be a little different due to the severity, however, I believe it is the best way to consolidate and explain what we are looking at here and what these characters represent, why, and its key importance. So lets break this down.

Koume and Kotake were named from the chacters from a 1977 movie "Village of Eight Gravestones". Which is a story about the heir to a family fortune who discovers that a curse has been placed on it, put there centuries before(16th Century) by a band of samurai warriors.

What does this have to do with Zelda? EVERYTHING!

The film was based on the book "Inugami Clan" where 'Inugami' means 'god of dogs' in japanese. 

Sounds like I am stretching I know, but bare with me.

"Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, 
Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, 
I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Jacob. 

Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, 
It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."" 


Maybe thats a stretch... but wait a minute.

Tyre(Kotake) and Sidon(Koume) are port cities located in modern Lebanon on the Mediterranean coast. 
Sidon(Koume) is believed to have existed prior to 2000 BC, with Tyre(Kotake) being just a little younger. 


Tyre and Sidon were consolidated into one kingdom Or "TwinRova".

 Throughout history, Sodom and Gomorrah(Koume and Kotake) have been used as metaphors for rape, homosexuality, sexual immorality, and race mixing fornication.



Matthew 21-24
 "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! 
 for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, 
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment(halos in the cutscene), than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom(TwinRova), it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom(TwinRova) in the day of judgment(Halos in cutscene), than for thee."


Tyre ﬂourished for another 400 years(Age of Koume and Kotake) as the largest and richest of the Phoenician cities. During this time, we know the names of the kings but all other history and information on record is mostly if not nearly completley in connection with the Israelite kingdoms and is told to us through scripture in the Bible and Josephus.

After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth, Capernaum became the next to reject him even after the all the evidence laid out before them. 

2 Peter 2:7-22
"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness(racemixing), and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. But these, as natural brute beasts(mongrels), made(born) to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption(fornication); And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots(Non-Whites) they are and blemishes(marked skins), sporting themselves with their own deceivings(diversity) while they(mamzer bastards) feast with you; Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children(abominations): Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray(race mixing), following the way of Balaam(shitskins) the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

These are wells without water(spiritless), clouds that are carried with a tempest(violent/murderous); to whom the mist of darkness(shitskin/bad fruit) is reserved for ever(Deuteronomy 23:2). For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment(dont race mix) delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The "dog" is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."

Theres that "dog" reference again.


This is damning evidence and to think Koume and Kotake are the surrogate mothers of Ganondorf. Are twins, merge to become one, 1 is older than the other, 400 year reign, heartless & ungrateful confessions/accusations repeated 3 times which is biblical account of a witness, and halos emphazied to reflect judgement, while being defeated by the Mirror Sheild that reflects the spirit in which they stole. They are "secret leaders of the jewrudos" in which they maintain by brainwashing their puppet leaders, and live so long due to evil black magic(adrenochrome?) . 

As we see who the Inugami Clan was, we then understand the "Village of Eight Gravestones" reference in which the twins Koume and Kotake get their names. As well as their role, story, and connection to the timeline.


 "Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could revive only a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to prevent Twinrova's planned resurrection of Ganon." — Princess Zelda (Oracle of Seasons)

O the Calamity.
