                            <br> After reading this, ecspecially if you are a Zelda Fan or a NatSoc you will never see the franchise the same way.
                            <br> Whether you are New to Zelda or Familiar with the Legend of Zelda - this synopsis is written for you in mind.

                            <br> I instead will focus primarily on "Ocarina of Time" for this Sypnosis, for 2 reasons.

                            <br /> 2. The fact Ocarina of Time is the absolute best place to start - due to Ocarina of Time holds many of the fundamental keys to understanding - and provides the best & exciting way to explain and learn History.

            <p class="tc">From the Basics, to the obscure details. Our adventure to understanding Race starts here.</p>
                <br>
                <style class="img-responsive  center-block LNSTRACB lr-LNSTQues"></style>
                <br>
            <p class="pt"> Lets jump straight into this and kill 2 birds with one stone.
                <br> We all know the Aryan(Hylian) Princess, Aryan(Hylian)Hero, and Aryan(Hylian)History of Zelda.
                <br>
                <br> Well, if that were the case I wouldnt have this blog topic.
                <br> But what about the other Races? Particularly Muslims and Jews? What about those Deku Shrubs? Wolvos, Koroks, and all the others...
                <br> We will get into all of that here and much more - assuming of course I dont have to explain Hylians are White Europeans.
                <br>
                <br> To start off lets start with by far the most obvious and yet another "Race" who without surprise, have a Massive Backstory - When I say a massive backstory I mean a MASSIVE backstory!
                <br><br> Which is just as long, complicated, intertwined, symbolic, and Important as the Hylians(Aryan). Without <span class="pb">Zoras</span> nothing in Zelda makes any sense and would be just random storyline - which many are under that false impression.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h4>Zora/Rito</h4>
            <h5> 5 Min Read </h5>
            <p>
                I wonder how that fits into Zoroa-strian 
                <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TimeLine">TimeLine - Zoroastrians</a>

                How it connects at all to the Aryan/Hylians?
                <br> Look no further for their name says it all... boom, wahla, time to end blog now - is what I would say if it was actully that easy and that straightforward. However, explanation time.
            </p>
                <style class="img-responsive  center-block LNSTRACB lr-LNSTevo"></style>
            <p>
                <br> Lets start with the Fish to Bird as we can get into everything else as we progress, this evolution is one of the many keys to understand this mysterious puzzle.
                <br> 
                <br> Now lets go out on a limb and ask a basic question - an obvious question... what if this <span class="pb">water/fish race</span> is a clear link to <span class="pb">Atlantis</span>? Sure you can say I am stretching. However, Atlantis was a Paradise : but like Babylon symbolizes the downfall of man, no different than Eden. <br><br> 
                As the Zora appearance is also very much in appearance as described in Hyperbora. In which Without these blatant observations: the Evolution makes no sense -
                <br><br> To be sure everyone is on the same page - Zora to Rito is however supported in Zelda Historia(Verified) : extremley explicitly that <span class="pb">Zora</span> are a dual Race: aka <span class="pb">Ritos</span>, those who returned to the Skies.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Lets keep in mind Hylians are from the <span class="py">Heavens Skies</span>(SkyWard Sword). Named after Hylia. 
                <br>
                <br> Meaning this theory quickly demonstrates the
                <span class="pb">Zora</span> represent <strong>Atlantians</strong>, in which moves us into <strong>Hyperboria</strong> concept territory - and without any force at all : but with the right pieces of the puzzle we can solve this enigma.<br><br> 

                Lets start with just the <span class="pb">Zora</span> and put the <span class="pb">Rito</span> on the back burner for a oment. The <span class="pb">Zoras</span> home being on the <span class="pb">sea bed</span> where it becomes rather undeniable <span class="pb">Zora</span> flirts with the <span class="pb">Mermaid</span> concept - in distinctions being clearly descendants of <span class="py"> Hylians(Aryan)</span> at least in Europa Legends to say the least.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Sounds out there right... but that is because we must bring back in the Bible. Which will show us the <span class="pb">SeaBed</span> is not what one would expect it to be when we look through the <span class="pp">Lens of Truth</span>.

            This quote above will become of DIRE importance as we will see - EPICLY important. As it does not end there with <span class="pb">Rito-Zoras</span>, not even close. Here we can can see how fish became bird... in depiction. <br><br>
            But, I have already gotten ahead of myself a little bit quite a few times but as stated we will now see why we had to jump ahead a little bit to fill in the blanks. Every thing at its time and in its place. As we to move on to another aspect of <span class="pb">Zoras-Ritos</span>. 

            By now the point should be solid thus far - as we move into <strong> living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal mentioned in Ezekiel</strong>. <br><br>

        <section class="b-content">
            <p> Atlantis, again... how fitting the same concept, design, and Stone, is always repeated whenever "Time" is involved.
            <br>
            This time the "Time" aspect falls outside of this particular topic but is important to note here and now for it will become reoccuring.
            <br> Not to mention <span class="pb">Zoras</span> reflect all qualities of <span class="pb">Atlantians/Hyperborians</span>, for Arctitecture Design, Culture, Hierarchy, Majesty, Sophistication, and well the whole Nordicism narrative is at the core of <span class="pb">Zoras</span> which we will see again and again thoughout Zelda at its finest - at every turn.
            <br>
            <br> The <span class="pb">Zora</span> are a <strong>depiction</strong> of the White Race. As it is again crucial to mention <span class="pg">Link</span> is <span class="pb">Hylian</span>. Confused? Dont be, For this <span class="pg">Link</span> should clear things up... are <span class="pb">Hylians</span> <strong>Fish People</strong>?</p>

            <p>Are <span class="pb">Nayru</span>, <span class="pb">Princess Zelda</span>, and <span class="pb">Wisdom</span> represented as <strong>Fish</strong>? </p>  

            <p> As I said the <span class="pb">Zoras</span> are a very Massive Topic. And instead of trying to write everything about <span class="pb">Zoras</span> all at one time, it would be quite impossible with how intertwined - or at least coherent without focused topic/aspect.</p> 

            <p>As we continue the <span class="pb">Zora/Ritos</span>, etc will be brought into the fold to ensure nothing that will be presented will be forced, but presented in context!<br></p>

            <p>Much of this "Race" article is about <span class="pb">Zoras</span>: as we will return to <span class="pb">Zoras/Ritos</span> when we get deeper into the history in the <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TimeLine">TimeLine</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TriForce">Triforce</a> and <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religion">Religion</a> sections.
            <br>
            <br> This quick outline of <span class="pb">Zoras</span> will become crucial and critical as we proceed. However, I must insist on keeping topics as brief as possible but detailed, on topic, and in overview perspective - as to not overwhelm, frusterate, or confuse anyone on this adventure.
            <br>
            I truely do advise following this format presented for everything is intertwined, but for those that want to stay on the Zora/Rito topic you can jump... If this is your preferred choice I recommend Synopsis first for a grand overlay.</p>

            <p> Another Key Race whom have a much less complicated or extensive History, and less featured importance than say the Zora/Gerudo, yet - none the less are just as Important.</p>

        <h4> The Gorons </h4>
        <h5> 4 Min Read </h5>
            However! Their key importance are known as the Hylians(Aryan) Closest Ally in BrotherHood.
            <br> Which could easily be seen as the overall masses of Hylians(Aryan), the strong working class workers in the mines that serve shoulder to shoulder with their Hylian(Aryan) Brothers when called upon to defend and go to war.
            <br>
            <br> If Zoras/Rito are depictions of White Aryans and are in fact Hylians(Aryan), it is not far-fetched to say the same is not true for Gorons. In fact it makes more sense considering the Goron/Hylian BrotherHood(Aryan). Which in turn makes the Zora/Rito even more so apparent and less far fetched.
            <br>
            <br> The evidence Gorons are White Aryans says otherwise when History, Triforce, and Religion is presented.
            <br> As stated earlier in the <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Synopsis">Synopsis</a> about the <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Sheild">Shield - Mirror</a>. The Gorons without a doubt symbolize Muslims. Which we will see will become undeniable.
            <br>
            <br> Whom are still Aryan of a different cloth <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religion">Religion - Ishamael</a>, and far different than the Nordicism of the Zoras.
            <br> In greater detail here:
            <br><a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religion">Religion - Pre-Adamics</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TimeLine">Timeline - At odds</a>
            <br>
            <br> For instance their agriculture design is the polar opposite of Zoras, sophistication not even a contest, their majesty nature is non-existent.
            <br> The Gorons depiction shows a sandcolored mongoloid brute, with Blonde hair. Good natured, with a respectable Hierarchy.
            <br> Also important to note. When we get into the History we will see the Gorons and Zoras were in Major Conflict. <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TimeLine">Timeline - Zora/Goron War</a>
            <br> Which is demonstrated throughout Zelda consistently.
            <br>

                <br>
                <br> Which we will get into in

                <br>
                <br> But, to crystalize this overview on Gorons and Race a super breif overview.
                <Br>
                <Br> <b><i>

          </i></b>
                <br>
                <br> As other quotes that seem random until you realize they are not random at all. Such as:
            <br>
            <br> <b><i>
          "Chugging a glass of milk after soaking in the hot spring is very popular, Brother!" — Goron
          <br><br>
          "Ganondorf is causing trouble on Death Mountain again! He has revived the evil, ancient dragon Volvagia!" — Darunia<br><br>
          "Hear my name and tremble! I am Link! Hero of the Gorons! What? Your name is also Link? Then you must be the legendary Dodongo Buster and Hero, Link!" — Link (Ocarina of Time)<br><br>
          "A long time ago there was an evil dragon named Volvagia living in this mountain. That dragon was very scary! He ate Gorons! Using a huge hammer, the hero of the Gorons... BOOOM! Destroyed it just like that. This is a myth from long ago, but it's true! I know, because my dad is a descendant of the hero!" — Link (Ocarina of Time)
          </i></b>
            <br>
            <br> I feel it is safe to inject at this time - due to everything covered under Zoras. The Gorons mark and highlight in remarkable detail Atlantian/Hyperborian/White-Aryan/Nordics vs their Muslim Brother counterparts. A giant retelling as will become blantant & evidently clear.
            <br>
            <br> With a final quote which seems like a random quote : isnot random at all and perfect as we segway into the next Extremely important Race.
            <br>
            <br> <b><i>"I remember Big Brother used to always listen to the music that comes from the forest... Ah yes, the good old days... That music makes me feel nostalgic, too..." — Goron</i></b>

            <h4>The Lost Tribes</h4> 
            <h5>2 Min Read</h5>
 Could I be anymore vague? I know many are saying to themselves.
            <br> Lets begin with the Kokiri. Now other than possibly the greatest music in the series, let alone being the Earthly home of Link himself, and one of the most Iconic scenery of the world, all comes from the Land of the Kokiri.
            <br>
            <br>They are also Hylians(White-Aryan) : Which is confirmed by Nintendo.
            <br> They are identical to the Zoras, Ritos, and Aryan kin to Gorons as explained in Gorons.
            <br>
            <br> The Kokiri are Hylian(White-Aryan) children who got "LOST" in the KokiriWoods/FaronForrest, hence the "LostWoods".
            <br>
            <br> Unlike the Zora/Rito and a very important aspect is Ordan/Kokiri Forrest have kept their human forms - for the most part - as normally always depicted as White children. Which is where alot of theories and things begin to get very dark.
            <br>
            <br> Now, with that said alot of Zelda is VERY DARK! The meanings, lessons, messages that come out of the Darkness in Zelda is truly one of a kind, by returning the Light, by simply retelling TRUTHFUL HISTORY!
            <br>
            <br> This is why I added the Not-So Important to at least address one of ridiculous theories that these Hylian children/Kokiris were enslaved. As well it provides me with a good starting talking point.
            <br>

                    <div id="LWNON" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                        <div class="panel-body"> Lets get the not-so important stuff (point 1) - and misconstrued ridiculous stuff out of the way(point 2/3).
                            <br> 1. The green attire plays off the Peter Pan concept as everyone knows - was one of the sources of Zeldas founding inspiration.
                            <br>
                            <br> 2. Depending on ones perspective ; and many Zelda theories do promote this ridiculous notion that the Death of the DekuTree set these Hylian(Aryan) children free.
                            <br> In where (((Ganondorf))) may have done something tremendously Awesome on accident. Although this is purely perspective with 0 evidence what so ever: when on the contrary the Deku Tree had indeed kept the Kokiri children safe, even looking over Link whom his Mother entrusted the DekuTree with "The Hero of Times" life whom the DekuTree gave his life to Protect.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                             <b><i>"Now...listen carefully... A wicked man of the desert cast this dreadful curse upon me..."<br> — Great Deku Tree (Ocarina of Time)</i></b> In more detail here - <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religion">Religion - Tree of Life</a>

                                <br> 3 . This one will have an actual impact but exist due to the nonsense of the second point. Bold is true and will be adressed in the "Lost Tribe" overview. Non-bold is non-sense.
                            <br> <b>The LostWoods would continue to be seen thoughout Zelda, however Kokiri Forest would be "Lost" in those Woods and no-longer exist after Ocarina of Time.</b> The "cult" of lost children would become a settling ground for <b>Hylian Families called Ordan Village in one timeline, and completely eradicated in all the other timelines.</b>
                            <br>
                            <br> Any theory that embraces this "cult of childen" will do so without a single shred of evidence what so ever.
                            <br> It is Important to add this explanation here because this is taken into consideration for alot of other ridiculous Zelda theories. Including but not limited to - just a random story pieced together - timeline is a marketing gimmik - and Zelda is completley meaningless.
                            <br>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div> Hylian Children were not enslaved, and instead were extremely cared for and protected. Evidence of this is seen with Saria and Links relationship. As Saria being the Forrest Sage of the children of the source of all creation.

            <br>
            <br> However, the human children aspect like Zoras will become depictions in yet another forest race like the Kokiri known as the Deku Shrubs or Kokiri. Both - Deku Shrubs and the Kokiri are the Depiction of Hylians(White-Aryan). Children of the Great Deku Tree of Life.

                <br>
                <br> The Great Deku Tree is leader of the Deku Hylians(Aryan). This is yet another depiction of White-Aryans in being the Woods. This is also solid evidence of the "Lost Tribes" that these races are racial depictions and are indeed all Hylians(Aryan Kin) race in absolute fluidity.
            <br>
            <br>Another key piece of evidence is found in Majoras Mask. If you made it thus far then this will all become self-explanatory. As the Racial Awareness of what Zelda is all about will become undeniable and so obvious, that the History, events, and everything in Zelda is in fact a Giant History book in immaculate detail.
            <br>

                <br> Link can fit in to the all 3 depictions - all while keeping his White-child Kokiri appearance, However, he can not fit in to the Gerudo.

                <br> There are plenty of other examples, from Royal Family pacts, song, ritual, and many others I will not get into for I feel my case has been made solidly. In as few words as possible. As we dive into the history if will become evident German, American, Russian, and an Islamic kin.
            <br>
            <br> At the core sense of the bigger picture. All fought in Civil Wars for Land and Dominion, where all were granted a piece of the Land to be ruled how they saw fit. We are getting to the all out NatSoc in full effect. and just in time as we get into two other Massively Important races.
            <br> It should become apparent nothing in Zelda is accident.

            We have a Massive Backstory - When I say a massive backstory I mean a MASSIVE backstory!
            <br> Which is just as long, complicated, intertwined, symbolic, and Important as the Hylians(Aryan). Without jewrudos - nothing in Zelda makes any sense and would be just random storyline - which many are under that false impression.
            <br> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/640Z5GV/NST-Gerudos.png" /> Of course that brings us now to the the Gerudos.
            <br> jewrudos are desert thieves that absolutely hate White Western Civilization and whom in turn launch a war to conquer and destroy White Western Civilization whom they resent: and due to this resentment believe they were punished unjustly by the Hyrule(White-Aryan) "Dictatorship". (Look At That NOSE!!)

           Although it is the Gerudos that would end the Hyrulian Civil War between Zoras(White-Aryans)/Gorons(Muslim-Aryans) who would both join forces with Hylians(White-Aryan) which guides us back to the Spiritual Stones.

          "Beyond Gerudo Fortress and past the Haunted Wasteland are a goddess statue and the Spirit Temple. Because of differences in religion, the people of Hyrule say the Desert Colossus depicts an evil deity. Thieves loyal to Ganondorf and Nabooru use it as a base of operations, and experiments in brainwashing using magic are conducted there."<br><br>

          "The Desert Colossus's face...it sure looks evil!" — Navi (Ocarina of Time)<br><br>

          "Among those living in the light, interlopers who excelled at magic appeared. Wielding powerful sorcery, they tried to establish dominion over the Sacred Realm." — Lanayru (Twilight Princess)<br><br>

          "What do you think happened to the magic wielders who tried to rule the Sacred Realm? They were banished. They were chased across the sacred lands of Hyrule and driven into another realm by the goddesses." — Midna(Twilight Princess)<br><br>
          If this is the case then how are there still Gerudos? The Gerudos were not all slain or banished to the twilight, those banished to the twilight were your powerful sorcers and leaders. The rest would be normadic.

            <br>
            <br> Which is where we can bring the Zora back into the fold. To fully understand the Gerudo and Twili, we have to understand how the Zora(Hylian Atlantians) fit into all of this, ironically enough Zelda from the very beginning put that answer in Gannondorfs hand. Claiming this is a later adaption is not even possible.

            <p> Again we will return to Zoras but by now you should understand the Neptune reference. In where we must add in the aspect that ties this all together.</p> This goes deep, VERY DEEP! Next level deep and an introduction in which I could not figure out to explain more easily - by breaking it up among topics. This topic is massive and will be critical to give an idea of races as a whole and why they are fundamental to understand. So this breakdown will be a little different alittle more direct - due to the severity, however, I believe it is the best way to consolidate and explain what we are looking at here and what these characters represent, why, and the key importances. Without these racial truths, historical allegories, the Timeline makes no sense. Up to this point one could make the argument ok so maybe the depictions so far are accurate but so what they change nothing. So lets break this down for those who made said arguments.


            <h4>Koume, Kotake, and TwinRova</h4> 
            <h5>2 Min Read</h5>
            <p> All three are Gerudos, but they represent much more than just jewrudos. Koume and Kotake were named from the chacters from a 1977 movie "Village of Eight Gravestones". Which is a story about the heir to a family fortune who discovers that a curse has been placed on it, put there centuries before(16th Century) by a band of samurai warriors. What does this have to do with Zelda? EVERYTHING!
                <br> The film was based on the book "Inugami Clan" where 'Inugami' means 'god of dogs' in japanese. Sounds like I am stretching I know, but bare with me.
                <br class="r"></br> "Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Jacob.
                <br class="r"></br> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.""
                <br class="r"></br> Maybe thats a stretch... but wait a minute.
                <br class="r"></br> Tyre(Kotake) and Sidon(Koume) are port cities located in modern Lebanon on the Mediterranean coast. Sidon(Koume) is believed to have existed prior to 2000 BC, with Tyre(Kotake) being just a little younger.
                <br class="r"></br> Tyre and Sidon were consolidated into one kingdom Or "TwinRova".
                <br class="r"></br> Throughout history, Sodom and Gomorrah(Koume and Kotake) have been used as metaphors for rape, homosexuality, sexual immorality, and race mixing fornication.
                <br class="r"></br> Matthew 21-24 "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment(halos in the cutscene), than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom(TwinRova), it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom(TwinRova) in the day of judgment(Halos in cutscene), than for thee."
                <br class="r"></br> Tyre ﬂourished for another 400 years(Age of Koume and Kotake) as the largest and richest of the Phoenician cities. During this time, we know the names of the kings but all other history and information on record is mostly if not nearly completley in connection with the Israelite kingdoms and is told to us through scripture in the Bible and Josephus.
                <br class="r"></br> After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth, Capernaum became the next to reject him even after all the evidence laid out before them.
                <br class="r"></br> 2 Peter 2:7-22 "But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness(racemixing), and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. But these, as natural brute beasts(mongrels), made(born) to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption(fornication); And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots(Non-Whites) they are and blemishes(marked skins), sporting themselves with their own deceivings(diversity) while they(mamzer bastards) feast with you; Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children(abominations): Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray(race mixing), following the way of Balaam(shitskins) the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
                <br class="r"></br> These are wells without water(spiritless), clouds that are carried with a tempest(violent/murderous); to whom the mist of darkness(shitskin/bad fruit) is reserved for ever(Deuteronomy 23:2). For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment(dont race mix) delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The "dog" is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow(seed) that was washed to her wallowing(rolling around) in the mire(Mud)."
                <br class="r"></br> Theres that "dog" reference again.
                <br class="r"></br> This is damning evidence and to think Koume and Kotake are the surrogate mothers of Ganondorf. Are twins, merge to become one, 1 is older than the other, 400 year reign, heartless & ungrateful confessions/accusations repeated 3 times which is biblical account of a witness, and halos emphazied to reflect judgement, while being defeated by the Mirror Sheild that reflects the "Spirit" in which they stole. They are "secret leaders of the jewrudos" in which they maintain by brainwashing their puppet leaders, and live so long due to evil black magic(adrenochrome?).
                <br class="r"></br> None of this is conjecture. As we see who the Inugami Clan was, we then understand the "Village of Eight Gravestones" reference in which the twins Koume and Kotake get their names. As well as their role, story, and connection to the timeline.
                <br class="r"></br> Unless of course everyone of these are a coincidence. In the face of that awesome probabilty - I am going to have to say no way. The cutscene alone was extremley purposeful, the references... ah yes let get back to that reference...
                <br class="r"></br> In 1940s Japan, the wealthy head of the Inugami Clan dies, setting off a chain of bizarre, gruesome murders. Detective Kindaichi must unravel the clan’s terrible secrets of forbidden liaisons, monstrous cruelty, and disguised identities to find the murderer. -Inugami Clan
                <br class="r"></br> "Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could revive only a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to prevent Twinrova's planned resurrection of Ganon." — Princess Zelda (Oracle of Seasons)

            1. Prince Sidon - In the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, thereby making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.

            Tyre and Sidon were cities against which the prophets of the Old Testament had pronounced God’s judgment. Sodom was infamous as the city which, according to the Book of Genesis, God had spectacularly destroyed for its wickedness in the time of Abraham.

            It is frequently mentioned in the works of the Greek poet Homer and in the Old Testament; and it was ruled in turn by Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Alexander the Great, the Seleucids of Syria, the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, and the Romans. At that time Sidon was famous for its purple dyes and glassware.

            2. Divine Beast - Who was the Phoenician god Baal(Elephant - Ganesha) See the Colorful Cistern.
            He was also called the Lord of Rain and Dew. Which just so happens to be the curse of non-stop rain.
            Named after Princess Ruto, see Race. Mipha will carry on that relationship.


            1. Daruk - Is Hindi and Literally means "Dark Skinned". 

            2. Divine Beast - A Salamandar (serpent/dragon) named after Darunia. King Shalmaneser - See Race/Monsters.



            1. Urbosa - Wandering Harlot

            2. Divine Beast - Camel. Naboris wanders the East Barrens named after Nabooru - See Race.

            In Jeremiah 2:20-23

            For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;


            These have all been pretty basic but now we come to the controversy. 
            Where many claim the Timeline Contradicts or makes no sense... again - GO BACK TO THE BIBLE!


            1. Revali - Arrogant. PrideFul.

            2. Divine Beast - Eagle 

            In Jeremiah 49:16 & 22

            "The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks, who occupy the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagle’s, from there I will bring you down,” declares the LORD.  Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.""


            What is weird is many claim Medoh(eagle beast) is named after Medli from the WindWaker ... YET: all the other beast take their Names after the Sages of Ocarina of Time. So why all of a Sudden does thre pattern change? Time to take a closer look at this and after deep examination we will see this just is not to be the case. 

            In fact "Medoh = Meadow". As in "Sacred Forest Meadow"... "The Sacred Grove" in Twilight Princess in which we must look closer at "Ordona" being a Spirit of Light. Ordona is the only one of the four light spirits not bearing a name that references one of the Golden Goddesses. 

            This seems off topic but bear with me. This is super important.

            I know what you are thinking Ordona is a Goat not an Eagle - as Ordona is not part of Hyrule. To this I say true. But Link is not Ordonian. Seperate the Sheep from the Goats...

            "The blight will not stop with Hyrule. Before long, the entire world of light will fall into the hands of the king who rules the twilight. To save this land from the king of twilight, the lost light must be recovered. The THREE light spirits who have lost their light must be revived."-Ordona 

            Matthew 25:31-34
            “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
            Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."

            Revelation 12:13-17
            And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a Great Eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the Earth helped the woman, and the Earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

             "In the land covered in twilight, where people roam as spirits, you were transformed into a blue-eyed beast... That was a sign... It was a sign that the powers of the chosen one rest within you...and that they are awakening. Your name is Link. You are the hero chosen by the gods." — Faron

            "Look at your awakened form... The green tunic that is your garb once belonged to the ancient hero chosen by the gods... His power is yours. His is the true power that slept within you." — Faron

            Saria - A Sage of Farore aka Faron. Saria is Genesis 11:29. 
            Ot is Saria who is refrenced as the "Medoh/Meadow"

            This simple realization removes the only reference to Windwaker. And by no means was it even a stretch to do so. 
            Nothing from that timeline is referenced other than this weird makes no sense "Medli connection". 

            One can say the Korok references - but that would be as absurd than the Kokiri were monkeys. 
            Faron the Light Spirit is a "Lemar" not a monkey... a reference to "Lamar" in archaic whom is "Tamar".

            Genesis 38:12-13
            "And in processe of time, the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife died: and Iudah was comforted, and went vp vnto his sheepe-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. And it was told Lamar, saying, Behold, thy father in law goeth vp to Timnath to sheare his sheepe."

            and in the KJV and every Modern Version.

            Genesis 12-21
            "And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers(Keep in mind what was said about the Ordona Goat) to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

            And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep(O light spirit).

            And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

            When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
            And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

            And he said, I will send thee a KID(Goat)FROM THE FLOCK... And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

            And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet(Faron), and thy bracelets(Ring Tail), and thy staff(Light) that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him(a Sheep).

            And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

            And Judah sent the Kid(Goat) by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

            Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place."

            Link is not a Goat(Ordonian) : but a Sheep(Hylian) just like Judah and Tamar. The entire sequence is straight out of Twilight Princess as we dive into Midianitish(Midna) see "Beyond The Deep Cistern". 


            Which leaves only the Fallen Timeline and the Child Timeline in play... and both are heavily Referenced in BOTW. 
            Even Majoras Mask. 

            As I said this was very important. For the Biblical Timeline is in perfect sync with the Zelda Timeline to the last detail. 

            The Divine beast "Medoh" is "Meadow" Saria. Not Medli.

            Each of the Divine beast represent the Sages of Ocarina of Time... in perfect sync.
            Darunia, Nabooru, Ruto, and Saria.

            As for Impa is a main featured character in Breath of the Wild and finally Rauru/Gaepora
