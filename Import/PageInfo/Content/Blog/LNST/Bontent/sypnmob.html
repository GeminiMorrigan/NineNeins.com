                            <br> After reading this, ecspecially if you are a Zelda Fan or a NatSoc you will never see the franchise the same way.
                            <br> Whether you are New to Zelda or Familiar with the Legend of Zelda - this synopsis is written for you in mind.
                            <br class="r">
                            <br /> To save time and A LOT of reading and writing, in which I could easily write an entire book on -
                            <br> I instead will focus primarily on "Ocarina of Time" for this Sypnosis, for 2 reasons.
                            <br class="r">
                            <br /> 1. Due to familiarity on a mass scale.

                            <br /> 2. The fact Ocarina of Time is the absolute best place to start - due to Ocarina of Time holds many of the fundamental keys to understanding - and provides the best & exciting way to explain and learn History.
                            <br class="r">
                            <br /> Each Chapter of the story of "The Legend of Zelda" is identical in nearly every way overall, meaning the continuity : with MUCH MORE In Depth evidence of what I am and will be talking about in this writing which includes everything outside of "Ocarina of Time" as we will see.

                        <p class="pt"> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timeâ€™ was released in 1998 and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games anf franchises of all time.
                            <br> The fact that it has sold record shattering copies all over the World ; in which simply attest to the simple fact that when it comes to dealing with the jewish problem -
                            <br class="r">
                            <br /> the solution is a very attractive and appealing concept that draws the attention of everybody on Earth who wants to achieve justice and freedom.
                            <br> Ecspecially among White Youths.
                            <br class="r">

            <p>One last important fundamental barrier to go ahead and cross is that :</p>
            <p class="tc"><strong>The 3 Spiritual Stones are actually 1.</strong></p>
            <br class="r">
            <p class="tc"> The <strong>Spiritual Stones</strong> are earned by good deeds and unlock the Light.
                <br> The <strong>Spiritual Stones</strong> are references in which we will get into here :

                <br class="r">
                <br /> </p>
            <p> Which is some trinity action taking place : just not trinity you may be familiar with, but in a much truer sense - which seals Link away for 7 years.
                <br class="r"> This is the true nature of the <strong>Spiritual Stones</strong> - as for the reason in why they do this goes back to that <strong>"Time"</strong> aspect briefly mentioned earlier.
                <br> But, that would be getting way ahead of ourselves to explain at this Time(This pun does not escape me). In great detail here <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TriForce">Triforce - Time</a>
                <br class="r">
                <br /> The 3 <strong>Spiritual Stones</strong> will become <strong> very Important</strong> in which serve to create Future Bonds, fullfill Prophecy, and explain Our History... I mean Hyrules History.
                <br class="r">
                <br /> This will all solidify later on as we proceed and when & where things start getting very interesting - for many by the time we reach that aspect you will remember this one particular line - and think to yourself "this is what the author finds interesting?"
                <br class="r">
                <br /> Meanwhile, do not let this overwhelm you for I promise you now that the main fundamentals have been covered - all the trinity stuff will become crystal clear with no attempt or effort.</p>
            <p class="tc">Hopefully, I have not lost anybody, overwhelmed, or confused,
                <br> and everyone has a great understanding thus far.</p>
            <p> <strong>Just One More Thing</strong> : to make sense of all this we must first cover another extremely <strong>Important</strong> aspect that will give a huge help to visualize everything so you can actully see how deep this goes.
                <br class="r">
                <br /> The best way to do that Is to focus on Colors - which is so <strong>Important</strong> I went all out to make sure this blog reflected this <strong>FUNDAMENTAL</strong>. </p>
            <p class="tc"> There is only one thing left to say before we start.</p>

            <br class="r">
            <br /> That is because this is an inversion as old as Time itself.

            <p class="pt"> So is this all conjecture, right? <strong>NO!</strong>
                <br> <span class="pp"> This Shadow Beast </span> that came out the well is named <span class="pp">"Bongo-Bongo"</span>.
                <br> <span class="pp">"Bongo-Bongo"</span> is essentially just 2 hands beating on a drum - playing a drum beat everyone is dancing to. A politician, main stream media, pop-culture, etc. for quick examples.
                <br class="r">

                <br /> Yet, is just another reference to Poisioning the Well. In more detail here <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/TimeLine">TimeLine - Decadent Calamity</a>
                <br class="r">

                <br /> In short <span class="po">"Bongo" </span> was converted by the devils drum beat in reference to the <strong>Mirror</strong> of <span class="pp">"Bongo"</span> - the pied piper if you prefer - a shabbos goy if you understand that reference. All this to simply say <span class="po">"Bongo" </span> drank from the <span class="pp">poisoned well</span>.
                <br class="r">

                <br /> The <span class="pp"> "Shadow "Bongo" consumed the</span> <span class="po"> the Spirit of "Bongo"</span> due to <span class="po">"Bongo"</span> consumed <span class="pp">the shadow of "Bongo"</span> by drinking from the poisoned well <span class="pp">"the force of the evil</span> <span class="po">spirit"</span>.

                <br /> <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span> represents Culture decay. The avalance of evidence is fixing to snowball. In order for that to happen we have to step back to see the entire picture.
                <br> Where again our Path is split three ways as mentioned before. However, as we dive into <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span>, Cultue Decay, poisioning of the well we must be wise to take a step back and look at the whole picture.</p>
                <br class="r"><br />

                <p class="pt"> Why does this matter? I am sure you are asking and in much more detail here <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religion">Religion - NaviConcious/FreeWill</a>...well - it is solely because <span class="pr">Fire</span> and <span class="pb">Water</span> only come into the picture after the Main 3 <span class="pg">Forrest</span> <span class="po">, Spirit</span>, and <span class="pp">Shadow</span>.
                <br> More than the others is the <span class="po">Spirit Temple.</span> 
                <br class="r"><br />

                Navi sure lives up to her name and reputation for reasons that make sense now. Until of course they don't with Navi. Where we must pause and reflect to see how <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span> in tied into everything! This is where Navi shines. Why is Navi so annoying - she was trying to tell you something - but were you listening?
                <br class="r"><br />

                The next few paragraphs are irrelevant to most who are new to Zelda or just interested in Zelda, NineNeins, or just the overall Theory. However, I have to put this here and now... you will see why later. To understand Poisioning the Well, <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span>, culture decay, this grand overview will become relevant.
                <br class="r">

                <br /> What I mean by all this is the <span class="pg">Forrest(Bow)</span>, <span class="pp">Shadow(Lens of Truth, HookShot, HoverBoots)</span>, <span class="po">Spirit(Mirror Shield/The Split of a Timeline)</span> . Are absolutley critical!
                <br class="r"><br />

                Meanwhile, <span class="pb">Water(Upgraded Hookshot)-signifant detail</span> and <span class="pr">Fire(Hammer)-signifigant detail</span> both inwhich act more as sidequest, and the rest of the story is all in arrows in much more detail here <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Shield">Shield - Arrows Direction</a>. But this is getting way ahead of ourselves - but in perspective of the whole picture instantly a trend is forming.
                <br class="r">

                <br /> It is also to point out the observation that <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span>, <span class="pp">TwinRova</span>, and <span class="pp">Phantom Ganondorf</span> are found in <span class="pp">Shadow</span>, <span class="po">Spirit</span> &<span class="pg">, and Forrest</span>.
                <br class="r">

                <br /> As <span class="pr">Volgaia/Flare Dancer</span> & <span class="pb">Morpha/Dark Link</span> are Historical Links/Events named perfectly in which we will understand shortly; as I said the rest of the story.

                <br /> With the removal of certain content, other versions had to adapt both in "Ocarina of Time" and outside - such as for example the <span class="pr">Hammer</span> is now needed for the <span class="po">Spirit</span> Temple - this is due to <span class="pr">Mirror Shield/Soundtrack</span> were forced to be removed from the game... Navi seems to be all over the place - until she isnt. The details provided attempt to give a quick overview.</p>
                <br class="r">

                <p class="tc">Its alot, but ignore it if you dont understand or feel lost. Way ahead of ourselves.</p>
                <p class="tc pi">All of this is so much more simplier than it sounds as we will see, it is easier to put all the pieces on the table and let them fall in to place 1 at a time - trying to explain <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span> has to be done in stages - without losing focus of the Whole Picture... which brings us back to <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span>... </p>

                We see this is every portrayal even in "Ocarina of Time" where <strong>Ingo</strong> takes other peoples hard earned cash to make fruitless business ventures, rife with hollow promises at Lon Lon Ranch. Funny thats the definition.

                Now back to this <span class="pb"> "Mermaid Key"</span> before we get way ahead of ourselves.
                I remember a few moments ago you were thinking what do the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> have to do with the deception and inversion, or the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> have to do with <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span>... now that we have covered the tip of the iceberg, we can bring back in the <strong> <span class="pr">Mirror Shield</span></strong>.

                <br class="r"><br />

                We are one step closer to fully understanding that aspect now that we have the <span class="pb">Mermaid Key</span> which tells us <span class="pr">Gorons</span> have a deep connection with <span class="pb">Zoras</span> also with <span class="pp">In</span><span class="po">Go</span> the bridge between. This seems like a weird connection until what has been presented thus far is understood.

                <br> Lets see what this <span class="pb">Mermaid Key </span> unlocks - but in order to grasp this we must return back to the begining of time and open the door to the <span class="pb">Ancient</span> <span class="pr">Cistern</span>.

            <br class="r"><br />

            Which just so happens to be protected by 3 ... you guessed it <strong>Frogs</strong>. Which require being given water to open the <span class="pr">Fire Sanctuary</span> which is on <span class="pr">top of a Mountain</span>. 2 of them can receive water from Links bottles.(This will become clear in a little bit). The last one is a Giant Frog.

            Why is any of this important?
            <br class="r"><br />

            This brings us to that <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> aka <span class="pr">Gorons Vase</span>. Where we meet <span class="pp">Demon Lord: Ghirahim</span> aka the <strong> Dragon</strong>.
            <br class="r"><br />

            Notice the <span class="pg">Emblem</span> on the <span class="pb">Cistern</span> which is needed for the final <strong>Giant Frog</strong> and <span class="pb">who is inside.</span> This is why we must carry the <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> to the top of <span class="pr">Death Mountain</span> to throw the <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> into the <span class="pr">"Volcano", "Death" Mountain</span> to destroy the <span class="pp">Idol</span> which is adopted by <span class="pr">Gorons</span>
            <br class="r"><br />

            It is imporant to note <span class="pb">Faron</span> will cease being the <span class="pg">Guardian of the Forrest</span> after these events of flooding the <span class="pg">Forrest</span> leading to the creation of the <span class="pb">"Zoras"</span>.

            However, before we do let me quickly explain the "Young Lion" in the last Bible verse. We will cover this later but that connection seems appropriate to put here as a great prequel when we get to the Timeline split - and also will put in perspective everything stated here is True. As it should be a perfect way to sum up the "Colorful Cistern".

                    Future proves past as the Past proves the Present. The Timeline once again shines in perfect harmony. But what does this have to do with <span class="pr">King Dodongo</span>, the <span class="pr">Gorons</span>, or the <span class="pb">Mermaid Key</span>?

                    Look into the <span class="pr">Mirror Shield</span>. We are nearly at the very bottom of this <strong>Broken Cistern</strong> of <span class="pp">Bellum/Baalim</span>, <span class="pb">Zoras</span>, <span class="pb">Ocean Kings</span>, <span class="pr">Gorons</span>, <span class="pr">Fire Kings</span>, <span class="pp">jewrudo</span>, and the <span class="pp">Twili</span>.
                    <br class="r"><br />

                    We have the same thing occuring <span class="pr">Mirror Image</span> of all those that adopted that same <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span>, with <span class="pp">one of them</span> being the creators of the cursed <span class="pg">Ancient</span><strong> Broken</strong> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> now the <span class="pr">Goron Vase</span>. 
                    <br class="r"><br />

                    We also have a Timeline split in <span class="pp">three</span> <span class="pb">seperate</span> <span class="pr">paths</span> that lays before us. One is <span class="pb">Flood</span>, one is <span class="pr">Fire</span>. and one is <span class="pp">Twili</span>! Thats how we got here.

                    The <span class="pr">Fire Kings</span> just like <span class="pp">Midna</span>(Midianitish Woman), <span class="pp">Zant</span>(Zur), and the <span class="pb">Ocean Kings</span> - are named and Titled "<span class="pr">King</span>" such as <span class="pr">Helmasaur King, Gemesaur King, Helmaroc King, and of course King Dodongo</span>. <br>For along time very little about the difference in all these faction tribes was unknown in that region other than they were "Roving Creatures"- summed up as just some "<span class="pr">Hothead.</span>". All being enemy "Nations"/Rivals of the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> whom are actully Racial Brothers.
                    <br class="r"><br />

                    Making it thus far I feel it is safe to say <span class="pr">Gorons</span> are generally<span class="prIslamic">Islamic by Faith but not all by race.</span>
                    <span class="pr">Darunia, Darmani III, Gor Coron, Darbus</span> create the <span class="pr">Goron</span> Hierarchy/Kings - whom were wereing with the other "King Dodongos" in the region whom are purely muslim - an entirely different race - represented as serpants, dragon beast, lizards, and other "roving creatures" - unlike the <span class="pr">Gorons</span>.
