                        <p class="pt">From the Basics, to the obscure details. Our adventure starts here.
                            <br> After reading this, ecspecially if you are a Zelda Fan or a NatSoc you will never see the franchise the same way.
                            <br> Whether you are New to Zelda or Familiar with the Legend of Zelda - this synopsis is written for you in mind.
                            <br class="r"><br /> To save time and A LOT of reading and writing, in which I could easily write an entire book on -
                            <br> I instead will focus primarily on "Ocarina of Time" for this Sypnosis, for 2 reasons.
                            <br class="r"><br /> 1. Due to familiarity on a mass scale.
                            <br class="r"><br /> 2. The fact Ocarina of Time is the absolute best place to start - due to Ocarina of Time holds many of the fundamental keys to understanding - and provides the best & exciting way to explain and learn History.
                            
                            <br class="r"><br /> Each Chapter of the story of "The Legend of Zelda" is identical in nearly every way overall, meaning the continuity : with MUCH MORE In Depth evidence of what I am and will be talking about in this writing which includes everything outside of "Ocarina of Time" as we will see.
                            <br class="r"><br /> But first lets introduce :
                            <br> </p>

                            <h4>"Zelda Ocarina of Time"</h4>
                            <p class="pt"> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timeâ€™ was released in 1998 and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games anf franchises of all time.
                            <br> The fact that it has sold record shattering copies all over the World ; in which simply attest to the simple fact that when it comes to dealing with the jewish problem -
                            <br class="r"><br /> the solution is a very attractive and appealing concept that draws the attention of everybody on Earth who wants to achieve justice and freedom.
                            <br> Ecspecially among White Youths.
                            <br class="r"><br /> Consider this writing the tip of the spear. The formal Introduction: In attacking the Jew, one is battling evil itself.
