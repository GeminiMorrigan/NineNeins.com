                        <p class="pt">From the Basics, to the obscure details. Our adventure starts here.
                            <br> After reading this, ecspecially if you are a Zelda Fan or a NatSoc you will never see the franchise the same way.
                            <br> Whether you are New to Zelda or Familiar with the Legend of Zelda - this synopsis is written for you in mind.
                            <br class="r"><br /> To save time and A LOT of reading and writing, in which I could easily write an entire book on -
                            <br> I instead will focus primarily on "Ocarina of Time" for this Sypnosis, for 2 reasons.
                            <br class="r"><br /> 1. Due to familiarity on a mass scale.
                            <br class="r"><br /> 2. The fact Ocarina of Time is the absolute best place to start - due to Ocarina of Time holds many of the fundamental keys to understanding - and provides the best & exciting way to explain and learn History.
                            
                            <br class="r"><br /> Each Chapter of the story of "The Legend of Zelda" is identical in nearly every way overall, meaning the continuity : with MUCH MORE In Depth evidence of what I am and will be talking about in this writing which includes everything outside of "Ocarina of Time" as we will see.
                            <br class="r"><br /> But first lets introduce :
                            <br> </p>

                            <h4>"Zelda Ocarina of Time"</h4>
                            <p class="pt"> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time’ was released in 1998 and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games anf franchises of all time.
                            <br> The fact that it has sold record shattering copies all over the World ; in which simply attest to the simple fact that when it comes to dealing with the jewish problem -
                            <br class="r"><br /> the solution is a very attractive and appealing concept that draws the attention of everybody on Earth who wants to achieve justice and freedom.
                            <br> Ecspecially among White Youths.
                            <br class="r"><br /> Consider this writing the tip of the spear. The formal Introduction: In attacking the Jew, one is battling evil itself.

        The Triforce. One of the Most iconic Symbols in the World. But what does it mean, what does it do, why is it so popular. The answer is one for Everybody, not just Zelda fans.

        Starting with: "The Legend of Zelda’ has many Pagan and/or Shaman themes and pre-historic symbolic references. Worldy religions and such are in many productions as is no secret nor mysterious in any sense of the word. However, prepare to see Zelda in a way you have never seen it before. 

        The Triforce which is the most famous Center Symbol of the Entire Franchise and is referred to as “The Golden Power” in ancient Hylian literature. As an omnipotent sacred relic, representing Essence of the Golden-haired Goddesses whom defends the realm of Hyrule.

        The Triforce in legend is more so practical in reality and appeared where the fallen departing the realm for the heavens or Valhalla: “hall of the slain." So at core "The Triforce" is based on ancient Nordic Rune symbolizing the Nine Worlds.
        You start seeing where 9Neins got its inspiration.

        However, Zelda goes much deeper than symbolism. Which I go into here Religion/Faith.

        <h4>
        If you did not know that, the more you know. If you did, well prepare to witness the Triforce in all its glory.</h4>

        3 Pieces? Water(Wisdom), Fire(Power), Earth(Courage).
        But there is a Fourth piece that is missing. 

        A 4th Piece that is Invisible/Hidden or In Shadow surrounded 
        by the other 3 Pieces...Look in the Middle... the inverted one.

        Lets keep in mind the name of Hyrule = High-Rule.
        As there is also another Kingdom called LoRule = Low-Rule.

        Simple enough. But, what the Triforce does not do like the one in Nordic tradition is interlock.
        Or does it?
        Let's look closer, if the 4th Piece is a Portal being sealed by the other 3 pieces. Causeing the Interlock, much like in Nordic Tradition.

        Slap me and call me crazy but I have a serious question...What if the 4th piece is "Time"?</div>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/rcS1kmm/NST-High.png" height="100" width="200" /><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k9vdJF3/NST-Lorule.png" height="100" width="200" />

        <a href="https://i.ibb.co/37ZnfTc/NST-Tri-Layout.png"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/37ZnfTc/NST-Tri-Layout.png" height="170" width="170" /></a><a href="https://i.ibb.co/yyYYpv3/NST-DOT.png"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yyYYpv3/NST-DOT.png" height="170" width="170" /></a><a href="https://i.ibb.co/MGQNwrD/NST-Trip-Pow.png"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/MGQNwrD/NST-Trip-Pow.png" height="170" width="170" /></a></div>

        The White Line seems to represent Lorule(LowRule). If it ever rose to Hyrule, the demonic Jews and their Satanic Symbol is clearly seen.

        Notice the only "Purple" medallion(Purple Inverted Triforce Piece),
        As well as the color of the door of time.

        What comes through those gates when opened? Ah, right demonic Judens... I mean demons.

        {If you read the previous article before jumping straight to the Triforce remember I told you to Remember that color}.

        The Low Rule/Darkness is Jewry.
        Full of Hatred and "Malice". Who seek "Demise" their DemonLord.

        The Temple of "Time" is to ensure they never get what they want most of all. They already have incredible "Power"(Ganondorf). (((Media))), (((Banks))), (((Blackmail on Politicians))), etc. even their Tax funded Terrorist organization like ADL, SPLC, or what have you.

        With the Wisdom(Zelda), and Courage(Link), WE must seal the "Fourth Piece", in which is inverted in the center, which indeed opens the gate to "Hell".

        Whoa, slow down just one second. These are big claims.

        <div style="text-align: center;">

        There is that purple again!! Same as Gerudo weapon choice, style, and traits. The "Garo" are deceased Gerudos, as we will soon see other Gerudos who were banished called Twili, who are a mix of Gerudo/Sheikah..

        Yet lets stay on Garos for they give another piece of the puzzle.
        Anyone that has played Zelda knows the most Famous of the Garo/Sheikah.

        So Purple is playing a Massive Role!!! More so than ll the others. As seen with the Mirror Shield, but it does not stop there. Things go much more specific, read more about that here.
        For now we will stay on this specific topic in understanding the Triforce.

        Such as Majoras Mask Title is "Purple" signifying is taking part in Lorule.
        Termina = Lorule. (More on this later)

        Let me guess just another "Mistake"? 
        There is no way one can deny what I have written is the most commonsense thing written on the Zelda Series.

        Unless all out denial.
        The Message Has Always Been Right in Plain Sight.
        The Timeline HAS NEVER BEEN FLAWED, everyone simply refused to accept what was in front of them, or were conciously unaware.

        Now we have many things to consider. Religion, Race, Triforce, Hy-Lo(Rule), and TimeLine.
        Not to mention The Mirror Shield and The Color Purple, the fourth piece, all centered on "TIME".

        Lets quick recap. Hylians(Aryan), need to stop the Gerudo(Jews) from combining Hyrule with Lorule. 

        If they ever merge Hell will be brought to the service as Ganondorf/Demise shall Rule in Darkness! 
        Well what would that exactly look like had Hyrule and Lorule ever merged.
        <a href="https://i.ibb.co/JjHZKz0/NST-SYS.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://i.ibb.co/JjHZKz0/NST-SYS.png" width="236" /></a><a href="https://i.ibb.co/PsyZDKG/NST-Communist.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://i.ibb.co/PsyZDKG/NST-Communist.png" width="236" /></a><a href="https://i.ibb.co/M9KD63k/NST-Glow.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://i.ibb.co/M9KD63k/NST-Glow.png" width="236" /></a>

        Yes, LoRule has invaded Hyrule many times, throughout the Centuries. Heros of Time have stood up against them Time and Time again. When Lorule comes so does degeneracy, the faithless, the hunger, everything inverted, no truth, and only death. 

        The Inverted Piece of the Triforce is Purple, for Purple represents Shadow, as Shadow is Time. 

        Time is exactly all (((Ganondorf))) has in the Shadows. Hence this is why the Nordic Rune is Interlocked. Symbolizing a Seal (How fitting once again, just another mistake?).

        How about we add up all these "Mistakes". Which have systematically been displayed and only becoming more and more obvious.

        Who and what is Ganondorf? A Jew.
        Who and what are Gerudos? Jews.
        Who and what are Jews? Communist.

        For those that have played Majoras Mask, remember how dark, sad, and tragic the game was.
        Remember how the Title was in Purple. Accident? No! So many Perfect cohencidences.

        <div class="separator" style="box-sizing: border-box; clear: both; font-family: domine, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">

        A land called Termina which means Terminal. 
        SYNONYMS FOR TERMINAL
        (final, ending, ultimate,fatal, mortal, lethal, death, end)

        The main city is "Clock Town". (Time)
        This is Lorule!

        Where everyone is terrified just waiting for the end while counting down the days.
        A place where souls are ripped, Misery is everywhere, With no Hope in sight.

        And yes the Title is Zelda written in Purple(Time)
        This will connect with the other Title Ages which is Also Purple, which was part of what was called the "Triforce Series", a trilogy with each title associated with a piece of the Triforce.
        Ages((Wisdom)Purp), 
        Seasons((Power)Red), 
        and Mystical Seed of Courage which was never released.

        Or Was It?

        The complexity of coordinating three games caused for the cancellation of the third title, Mystical Seed of Courage. Or did it?

        Considering what we know from Colors, Purple=Shadow/Time, Red(Power), it is safe to assume being the ONLY other colored Zelda Title - Four Swords Adventures is(Green) which would give you your trilogy.

        Scroll up to the list of Title Screens and see for yourself. Which gives a MUCH clearer meaning of what is going on now.

        Let me guess that was just another mistake too right? :)

        Even though it would flawlessly Connect the Child Timeline back before the Timeline Split of the Four Swords, to continue down the Fallen Timeline. While Maintaining dire importance in the Child Timeline.

        As well as Once Again connecting Child Timeline((Termina)death) to the Fallen Timeline((Holodrum)genocide) and ((Labrynna)trapped).

        Also goes even further to concrete my race theory as well as showcases just how important the Timeline Truly is. Dont forget the Mirror Shield I covered here also Shield.
        More on all of this in the future. But I will hint "Holodrum"(Holodomor) is not complicated nor "Labrynna"(Labyrinth) to understand what is Zelda.

        We are reaching a point where you cant just keep saying these are all just thoughtless mistakes, accidents, cohencidences, or what have you. The percision across the board, meticulously placed and connected, down to the very landscapes, to color schemes. 

        To the Placement of how the Triforce is placed on the box 

        In time, pun intended.

        Whoa that escalated quickly, lets ascend back up, and get back to Zelda. 
        It gets even better. When you know what you are looking at, things just start clicking into place with no force at all.:)
        Everything becomes so obvious.

        This is where the Interlopers, Sheikah, and Twili, come into play. Remember that "Lens of Truth", the Shadow "Medallion", Their "Color Purple", as the well the "Symbol". To Understand the Sheikah we must know who Impa is.

        "Someone must stay behind to watch over this blade. His spirit must not reawaken. He must never be allowed to threaten the world again. This is the nature of the task given to my tribe.

        The Sheikah guarded the Gate of Time. As the symbol is the very symbol of the "Lens or Truth". The Sheikah are not generally bad but became resentful of Aryan dominion, against Impas wishes. This is the cataclysm story in the Bible known as the Fallen Angel and his 1/3 that followed. The Sheikah who followed the Fallen one became known as the Interlopers, Masters of Shadow magic.

        They crafted a device called the Fuse Shadow in secret and teamed up with the (((Gerudos))) to overthrow Hyrule by claiming the Triforce for themselves creating the (((Gerudo Curse))) of only one boy and he shall be King.

        However there would be another crafted also. Not to mention the "Hover Boots, Lens of Truth, Gossip Stones, the Mask of Truth, or the All Night Mask Torture Device" for a quick look at the marvel technologies. Also notice their obsession with MASKs. Have we not seen this guy before?<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
