                            <h4>Terminology/Reason</h4>
                            <h5>2 Min. Read</h5>
                            <p>Open Source: Open Source is generally free and the code is public; meaning you will usually have full access to the program's code.</p>
                            <p>Licensing: Proprietary Software (not Open Source), such as Windows/Apple and other big name brand Softwares/Services.</p>
                            <h5>Perpetual</h5>
                            <p>I do not lease software nor do I purchase subscriptions; unless they fall into specific niches, such as: Email, VPN, Hosting, and the like. I will never spend money on general software that I find myself rationalizing the reasons as to why I need a specific tool or program, at a specific cost/ratio.</p>
                            <h5>Leasing</h5>
                            <p>Leasing is normally a perpetual license. In many cases it grants access to future updates (read the terms of software). Sometimes these updates are time sensitive; again read the terms of the software.</p>
                            <h5>Subscription</h5>
                            <p>This is 100% time sensitive.</p>
                            <h5>Pros/Cons</h5>
                            <p>The pros and cons of my own method (Perpetual/OpenSource) are as follows.</p>
                            <h5>Cons</h5>
                            <p>1. Locks you into a particular version.</p>
                            <p>2. Much more expensive upfront.</p>
                            <p>3. Updates and new features will expire upon the release of a new version.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Pros</h5>
                            <p>1. Security.</p>
                            <p>2. No Subscription.</p>
                            <p>3. Own your copy.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The choice will depend on what you want to accomplish and your projects. Not all are logical selections for everyone and it will vary depending on your particular needs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Cost</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I hold the opinion that, if you use a software as a main tool, then you should support that company.</p>
                            <p>Perpetual licencing is fantastic for well built software, longevity, and solid computer life.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Ratio</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>A prime example of this is Adobe Products. The only REAL difference between Adobe CS6 and the newest version (CC:Creative Cloud) is the name, the Cloud, and the fact that it is now ONLY subscription based.</p><br>
                            <p>Perpetual licencing has kept me from having to deal with that nightmare.</p>
                            <p>I have all the perks of Adobe- without the forced updates and without granting corporate access to my devices in order to use their products. Keep in mind that these products are bundled with a ton of things you will never need or want. This turns solid software into Bloatware- and, in most cases, you pay for that bloat.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Not all updates are good. Subscriptions make you dependent.
                                Leasing software has you completely at the mercy of corporations in many instances.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Do not be a slave.</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I encourage you all to support developments. I must point out that there is a difference between supporting and being extorted.</p>
                            <p>Be mindful of this as you review your budget and begin making choices of how you want to license the product. It is entirely up to you- UNLESS Adobe, Microsoft, Avid, etc. say otherwise.</p>
                            <p>It does seem expensive for perpetual licenses to cost anywhere between $50-$600!</p>
                            <p>Currently, the majority of subscriptions start at $120/year (Basic: $10/month) and can be as much as $953/year (Pro: $80/month)!</p>
                            <p>Which one is cheaper?<br> Cost/Ratio= Perpetual licencing everytime.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>If I did not have a perpetual license before Adobe switched to "Cloud Subscription" 10 years ago- well, you would have to multiply that total by $120 for the basic packages (1/4 of what I currently own). This doubles the price and a payment is due again next month.</p>
                            <p>Having a perpetual license ends up being much cheaper and it also means I own the software (Pro Package). Adobe can take that cloud nonsense elsewhere!</p>

                            <p>This is important to know so that you understand my recommendations, logic, and software choices. It is just beneficial to keep this in mind as we progress.</p>
                            <h5>Alternatives</h5>
                            <p>There are alternatives that are just as good and sometimes even better. They come in a variety of Open Source and Proprietary.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Personal Example</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I just recently put off updating a perpetual license for a software that I own (Version 3). I did not realize the newest (Version 5) release would fall into the "OS Limitation" trap.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This blunder cost me many features for that software because it was rewinded back to my paid version. There was no way to update to the last working version (Version 4).</p>
                            <p>I could update but I would hit the OS Limitation. This would force me to upgrade to Win 10.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>No, thank you! The software version I want for that program (Version 4) is no longer available.</p>
                            <p>The worst part is that there is no alternative for that software. I took a gamble by passing up the $65 upgrade and, like most gambles, the House won. This is covered in greater detail within the "Legacy" section.</p>
                            <p>Keep this at the forefront of your mind when I recommend a perpetual license. I am not trying to sell you something! There is a good reasoning behind it.</p>
                            <p>If I had the option to upgrade to that software (Version 4) again, I would not think twice this go around! Sometimes it is better to be safe and not sorry.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>This browser is the best option currently available. It only takes a few seconds for you to revolutionize your web experience.<br> 
                                You will not even realize that you left Google Chrome! You did not stop using the framework.<br> 
                            The learning curve is non-existant and the familiarity is preserved. Most importantly, your freedom is given back to you. An Open Sourced Chrome is now in your hands.</p>
                            <p>What is Brave? It is best answered by Brave themselves: <br>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">To Download and Learn More</a></p>
                            <p>Changing over to Brave is simple. Just export your bookmarks/personal info/passwords and then import them into Brave.</p>
                            <p>It is so easily done that even the non-tech savvy can say goodbye to trackers, ads, and Google's agents! Say hello to Brave Search Engine! A complete alternative that is faster, more secure, and feature packed. Every device should be using Brave.</p>

                            <h4>Proton Mail/VPN</h4>
                            <br>
                            <p>Here, we will cover Email which just so happens to double as a VPN: <br> I should probably say a VPN that doubles as an Email.
                            </p>
                            <p><a class="tc pg" href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> and <a class="tc pg" href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a>.</p>
                            <p>ProtonMail is a company that values privacy. I believe everyone should know, use, and support them! All of the Proton features are encrypted and bundled so (like Google) one account syncs with everything.</p>
                            <p>There is not too much to add here as it is just an Email and a VPN. I have come to discover that many people do not have a VPN or use a VPN (for what ever reason). I can only strongly suggest that they should.</p>
                            <p>As for what a VPN is and isn't? I will not cover that here.</p>
                            <p>I will say that ProtonMail is one of a kind because it is encrypted end-to-end.</p>
                            <p>If you value privacy you should not be using Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.! Google employees and their affiliates, advertisers, sister corporations, friends, partners, agents, NSA, government, banks, anyone really- combs through your emails.</p>
                            <p>ProtonMail's encryption is End-to-End. This means the only people who can see your email messages are the sender and yourself.</p>
                            <p>Why are you not using ProtonMail?</p>
                            <p>The VPN feature is free, so if you were not using one (for whatever reason) you are now!</p>
                            <p>Proton's services are unmatched! They honestly have zero competition at this stage in the game.</p>
                            <p>In combination with Brave Browser, you can actully feel the protection like a blanket. </p>
                            <p> The price range is from $0 (yes, actually free including the VPN) to...</p> 
                            <p>Paid plans starting at $5 for Basic and $12 for Unlimited (both are reasonably priced). Both provide a better user experience. I would also like to mention that these packages come with Bridge; which we will get into momentarily.
                            </p>
                            <p>Compare that to Netflix: starting at $10/month and Amazon Prime at $15/month for the majority of households.</p>
                            <p>Having a subscription to Amazon only makes sense because the shipping is free; which pays for itself. The same can be said for ProtonMail/VPN.</p>
                            <p>It is important to mention that Brave also offers a VPN; which is built in. The cost is identical to ProtonVPN (which has far more value when bundled with Mail/Bridge). </p>
                            <p>There is no valid reason that anyone should not make this subscription based.<br> It works on Mobile too!</p>

                                <p>Everything most people have used Google for and the reason many people still do... <br> are the same exact same reasons that are conveniently available from Proton with one account.</p>

                            <p>Bridge allows you to bring ProtonMail to the desktop using a client of your choice. I happen to promote Thunderbird as a client for several reasons: Thunderbird is open source, highly customizable, and I have used it forever because it is reliable.</p>
                            <p>Drive is a Cloud storage that allows you to have Cloud access.</p>
                            <p>Calendar... Well, it is a calendar. I've personally found that it is much better than Google's which adds fake holidays like sodomy month, juneteenth and black made-up belief month.
                                <br>Just a good, solidly built, clean calendar without the globohomo political correctness being shoved down your throat. </p>
                            <p>The Calandar also secures your data, schedules, events, and appointments without the political correct Google agents all in your business.</p>

                            <p>The next step goes back into Brave's features - no downloads just settings and functions.</p>

                            <h4>CryptoWallets</h4>
                            <br>
                            <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWBraveMeta"></style>
                            <br>
                            <p>Now we can move to the unfamiliar territory. If you chose Brave, you have already started this process. Crypto Wallet comes built directly into the Brave Browser.</p>
                            <p>Even though it is limited because it is Ethereum based — and it only uses Wyre — a lot can be achieved through this Wallet. It is superb; especially if you are just getting started in the Crypto world. This replaces MetaMask and there is no need for an extension.</p>
                            <p>These features are whole programs that are used daily. I feel they are relevant enough to add them to the list.</p>
                            <h4><a href="https://uphold.com/signup?referral=aeb7fe32a1" target="_blank">Uphold :</a></h4>
                            <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWUpHold"></style><br>
                            <p>If you are serious about Crypto or want to get an Official Crypto Wallet.</p>
                            <p>We can do this directly from the Brave Browser and Link. In this case you would create an Uphold account. This process will require verification (ID and typical financial information) because you are opening a Crypto bank account. I cover this topic in more detail within the "Crypto Talk" section.</p>
                            <p>Once you are verified you will have access to the entire Exchange; which has a PayPalish feeling and allows you to send and buy Crypto all on the fly.</p>
                            <p>This is the easiest format for those looking for a Crypto like PayPal exchange.</p>
                            <p>You can then sync it to your Brave and receive your Brave Rewards (to tip or use as you like).</p>
                            <h5>Into the Real World.</h5>
                            <p>Uphold also offers a debit card (like PayPal) so you can spend your Crypto whenever and wherever - even out and about or to pay bills at no extra charge wherever Visa/Mastercard is accepted.</p>
                            <p>This is secure, however, it is very personal with your name attached to it just like a debit card. This is not Crypto Anonnomity (see CryptoTalk for more on this). Of course, there are other Crypto alternatives but for the vast majority, this is the easiest and fastest way to jump in.</p>
                            <h5>2FA</h5>
                            <p>The reality is that this market is very small. It is useful but it is also a destructive, double edge sword. I do not recommend this unless absolutely necessary- but I do not advocate against it as I use it religiously.</p>
                            <p>My only recommendation is Authy</p>
                            <p>Did I mention this is all built into Brave? Proton Suite offers all the security and privacy one could want...and more. Why are you using anything Google?

            <h4>Final Brave Thoughts</h4>
            <br>
            <p>By now it should be clear how powerful and amazing the Brave Browser is as a whole. As I stated, Brave/Proton will completely revolutionize your browser experience.</p>
            <p>With all the security built in (encryption, search engine, access Dapps, a Crypto Wallet (Link straight to Uphold), Tor (it works great but is not a replacement for Tor)) there is technically no learning curve.</p>
            <p>Please do not confuse me with a fanboy over the Brave Browser. Brave Browser is simply, hands down, wonderful and easy to use all around. In my opinion, this is ultimately the best way to judge a program or software. It also introduces the masses to alternative tech with practically one download and a simple setup of the accounts they require.</p>
            <p>Everyone I have gotten on Brave/Proton/Uphold is absolutely in love the setup. This opens the world of crypto to them without all the complications.</p>
            <p>Everything I recommend-I stand behind.</p><br>

                            <h5>Domains(DNS)</h5>
                            <p>I have to say, my only recommendation for domains is
                                <a class="pg" href="https://my.freenom.com/" target="_blank">Freenom</a> on this list. It is amazing all around! If you need a domain <a class="pg" href="https://my.freenom.com/" target="_blank">Freenom</a> is the absolute best! There is no alternative and no competition. So go support them!</p><br>
                            <h5>Hosting</h5>
                            <p> This is where things start getting sketchy and will exclusively depend on your content, skill, time, and dedication. Even more so if your content is as controversial or frowned upon as mine.</p>
                            <p>I am on the fringe where free versions of Parent Companies are my boundary and paying for such services in my shoes is a gamble - a gamble not worth putting money on the table for.</p>
                            <p>I suggest hosting yourself with tools like Apachee, for example- but that is a whole seperate adventure in and of itself. I will not get into server niches here.</p>

                            <h5>CDN</h5>

                            <p><a class="pg" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudfare</a> needs no introduction. It will be best bet 95% of the time. This topic can be broken down into 30 different sections of tech babble- just use Cloudfare.</p>

                                As we progress through the list, some of the software is not free per se. Some of them are not even available anymore in a giant sense (more on that in "Time to Stop Time").</p>
                            <p>There are great alternatives to everything I personally use. However, I can not recommend all of them or all alternates. Only those I have used AND I feel are worth it. Most of the alternates I use in combination.</p>

I have had steady business reinstalling Win 7 on other's computers.</p>
                            <p>Of course this is not a requirement...just a personal preference. It is more secure, better all around, and works flawlessly- which is why I recommend it.</p>
                            <p>There are plenty of alternatives in the OS world- excluding Apple (avoid it like the plague). Most notable are BSD and Linux- which are alternatives - but I tend to avoid recommending them unless specific machining deems it necessary.</p>

                                            <br>
                                            <p>Windows 7 is extremely stable and everything runs on it. This is just one of the greatest strengths of the many Win 7's strengths.</p>
                                            <p>The caveats of using Win 7 creates its weaknesses. So, let me address them and explain how they are easily fixed. This is NOT recommended if you don't know what you are doing.</p>
                                            <p>The main issues deal with typical Microsoft spyware. This is every Microsoft OS/program's problem. It is quite easy to overcome by simply not installing the final two updates during installation.</p>
                                            <p>Take note that there are a few others scattered throughout the installation (such as Skype) and most are attached to these programs.</p>
                                            <p>This is not really an OS problem but the default program's problem.</p>
                                            <p>Next, we will discuss bloat. This only really matters if you already know what I am talking about. If you do- then do your thing. If not- then this has no real relevance for you. Bloat is where all the other undesirables are hidden.</p>
                                            <p>Lastly, you simply activate (by whichever method you prefer: whether toolkit or serial) and done.</p>
                                            <p>Congrats on your newly found freedom with Win 7. Many will claim it is better to use something other than Win 7 because of the steps I laid out and they may claim that somehow the myth Alts are safer.</p>
                                            <p>This is the key: the moment you connect to the internet every computer enters the very same threat level. If that is the concern, do not connect to the internet.</p>
                                            <p>Remove all wireless hardware capabilities. This includes: Bluetooth, Wifi, etc. I have no Wifi for my computers (although both boards are capable of it). They are run via ethernet. This is important to harp on because no OS comes with Switch hardware - just saying.</p>
                                            <p>Of course this setup is not feasable for everyone; especially those on laptops (unless they remove their wifi chip - which sort of renders a laptop mostly useless). I have a laptop that does run Wifi and it has a purpose in the "Network".</p>
                                            <p>The moment any OS/Computer connects to the internet, you open a port. This has nothing to do with Win 7 or any other OS.</p>
                                            <p>Unlike Win 8-11/Apple, there is no software for auto updates to control, scan, access, verify, etc. on Win 7. (This was included in the final RollUp update of Win 7.)</p><br>
                                            <p>This is the reason why everyone should dump Win 8-11 and avoid it as I stated earlier (the last two updates for Win 7).</p>
                                            <p>Win 7 is just as safe (be safer and make changes to your network settings) as any Alternative— however unlike the other alternatives- only on Win 7 is everything compatible, everything installs, everything just works.</p>
                                            <p>I do run software that no other OS can accommodate. This list is just common tools and nothing special— many things listed are mainstream. That is another of Win 7s ultimate strengths.</p>
                                            <p>Here we just took the mainstream offline and turned it into an Alternative.</p>
                                            <p>A big improvement. Accomplished with ease.</p>

                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> and needs no introduction.</p>
                            <p>The only real alternative to
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> would be
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a> ,which is an Open Source and I use <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a> side by side with
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> because CCleaner is an absolutley wonderful development.</p>
                            <p>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> is a Freemium option (if you desire). This can come to an end or "OS" incompatible if you run older OS.</p>
                            <p>The take away here is that CCleaner is not expensive for what it does and everything it does.</p>
                            <p>As CCleaner has not been blocked the OS via the installer- let me pin a "yet" here.</p>
                            <p>The CCleaner perpetual license is still an option where I would recommend Pro+ at around $50 (version).<br>
                            I will get more into this in the Legacy section.</p>
                            <p>It is a tool that has the potential to go full Adobe and is becoming unusable without a subscription.</p>
                            <p>Like many softwares that are blocking by installer and all seem to be already compatible with Win 11...
                            <br><br>CCleaner has not added Win 11 to their site "yet". That is a possible connection and a plausible factor to consider. This creates a greater chance that they will block by installer and will most likely offer legacy options for those with a perpetual license.<br><br>Which may or may not be purchasable afterwards.</p>
                            <p>With that out of the way, CCleaner is a phenomenal piece of software that will not require all the updates that come with the Lease-Perpetual License because these particular softwares are tuned into the computers OS preferences. That is critical to understand and keep in mind!!!</p>
                            <p>Meaning, even when your version expires (either Update License or by OS)... the License simply covers the "Download" and subscription to update for that Version, not the program itself.</p>
                            <p>Essentially— it is a one time purchase that does not require the license to run and acts more as an Open Source donation — rather than a Corporate Software.</p>
                            <p>So why bother with <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a>?</p>
                            <p>Now we look to <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/">BleachBit</a> being an Open Source that does not have the license/download dilemma; also, the possible OS limitations that would require version rollback. Although extremely unlikely.</p> 
                                <p>Since it is Open Source, the OS limitation is not a problem (if it had ever been a problem). It is not due to it being limited by corporate pressure or Microsoft or any other's will.</p>
                            <p>BleachBit also surpasses CCleaner in many regards; especially when we get into file deletion. Although CCleaner does outperform BleachBit in scan and across the functionality spectrum, it is a Suite; not a single function (hence the name "C(omputer) Cleaner") just like BleachBit. </p>
                            <p>This helps to really differentiate between the two programs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Things Considered</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I like having a double checker with programs like these. They really do compliment one another and are two different tools for two different purposes.</p>
                            <p>This assuredly becomes a personnel preference.</p>

                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> is not really an IDE per se.</p>
                            <p>It is easy with the use of packages and the entire Github, NPM, PIP, etc libraries to turn it into an IDE, essentially.</p>
                            <p>The possibilities are quite endless and it is, in reality, just a text editor (an extremely integrated Notepad).</p>
                            <p>As far as recommendations go and software I use- this is my most used piece of software!</p>
                            <p>Do you have to have SublimeText?</p>
                            <p>Absolutely not! It is just my recommendation no matter your project, complexity, size, and goals. <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> is my trusted go to. </p>
                            <p>If the price is out of the budget- you can always just run with the trial forever.</p>
                            <p>As for other IDEs/TextEditors, I must be honest, I have been using <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">SublimeText</a> since it was released— and never really bothered with IDEs after that.</p>
                            <p>Most IDEs are syntax specific. There is that bottleneck in certain instances. As for text editors, I can only speak on those comparable to SublimeText.</p>

                            <p>Notepad++ and Atom are both free, would be alternatives.</p>
                            <p>You may hear some complain if I don't mention the "visual studio": which is also free. So let me mention it quickly.</p>
                            <p>Visual Studio is a typical Microsoft software that is bloated, clunky, and very slow compared to SublimeText and both of the alternatives.</p>
                            <p>Again, Notepad++ (which is also Microsoft) and Atom are both free and much better alternatives.</p>
                            <p>I would use Atom over Notepad++ if those were my choices. This is due to the fact that Atom is very much like SublimeText in many ways and it isn't Microsoft- sort of.</p>
                            <p>Just another one of those "sometimes a small pricetag is just worth it to me".</p>

                                <h3>Convertors</h3>
                                <p>This is a very large topic. Here are the top three I use and why.</p>
                                <h3>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://file-converter.org/" target="_blank">File Converter</a></h3> 
                                <p>When you deal with audio files, want an audio clip from a video, or possibly just to change quick video format on the fly.</p>
                                <p>This is where File Converter truly shines.</p>
                                <p>With a simple context menu straight from the folder.</p>
                                <h3>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a></h3> 
                                <p>It was created by WonderShare which offers many products (like Adobe). I only use one and can only recommend one of the softwares; also, their marketing campaigns are dodgy. They have an extremely solid product and it is, by far, my favorite in this category (Note: This one I DO have an affiliate for).</p>
                                <p> 
                                <a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a> covers many features in their toolbox; from TvCast, metadata fixer, and a screen recorder as bonuses.</p>
                                <p>Their download and convert is tremendous. Unlike File Convertor above UniConvert, it covers everything File Convertor does not, is not open source nor is it free like File Convertor. </p> 
                                <p>UniConvert is $80 (Perpetual Version License). I started using this product a long while ago and have never looked back. Naturally, this is because I am constantly converting files and most days I feel that is all I do!</p>
                                <p>There are many similar alternatives (almost the same exact developer kind of similar). Indeed, even the same code kind of similiar in many cases.</p>
                                <p>So why use UniConvert? UniConvert is the only one I know of that allows you to download straight from within the program (from say Bitchute/Youtube/etc) and straight into the conversion, clip, or audio.</p>
                                <p>UniConvert and File Conversion are the ultimate combination.</p>
                                <p>The final piece to this mini trilogy is another software I use constantly and highly recommend.</p>
                                <h3><a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a>.</h3>
                                <p> An outstanding effective software. Note, I do not use handbrake for conversions very often because that is not really where <a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> shines. Handbrake's compression is untouchable. This software is invaluable when it comes to compression. <br><br> <a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> can do so much more than just compress! It can double as an alternative to UniConvert or File Converter if you really wanted it to.</p>

                                <h3>All Working Together.</h3>
                                <p>It is important to note here that I do use "Adobe Bridge" for everything project related. It is really just a fancy folder structure.</p> 
                                <p>So to illustrate this process... <br><a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a> I use to: BringIn(DL)/Convert/Format/and Organize Folder Content.</p>
                                <p>File Convertor: if I'm looking to cut audio for audio editing and/or on the fly with previously downloaded files.</p>
                                <p>
                                Where I use Adobe Bridge for those files in the System. 
                                <br><br>
                                Then on Render - <a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> compresses all video on the output. <br>
                                The images go through Photoshop (TinyPng Plugin).<br>
                                Audio renders from Protools; mp3 being compressed.

                        <p>This has been a back and fourth challenge. <br><br>
                            As of now, there is a version for GoDot, Unity, Defold, and Renpy.</p>
                        <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWRenpy"></style>
                        <p>Renpy has become the story line and what I would call the Blueprint Engine. Truely revolutionary in many ways and it is capable of much more than what I currently use it for. Renpy is one of my favorite engines to work in, without a doubt.</p>

                        <p>Unity and GoDot are my jump betweens. NineNeins will most likely end up on 1 of these 2 engines. Right now I would say GoDot is the way I am leaning toward.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Both of these Adobe programs can be replaced with a number of other softwares. <a class="pg" href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> and <a class="pg" href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> are my recommended alternatives.</p>
                        <p> Both are free. I love and use them frequently because of their portability and lightweight design.</p>
                        <p> So why keep Photoshop and After Effects?</p>
                        <p> This has to do with the bridge between all the different aspects of Video Game Design; plus industry standard which makes cross platforming collaboration with other creators much simplier. Also, Photoshop is still my default image processor and also my default for projects.</p>
                        <p>After Effects I use just for that: "Effects"!</p>
                        <p>So why still use Gimp and Blender?</p>
                        <h3>Gimp</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Gimp is free and more suited for mobile. It allows collaboration with anyone who does not have Photoshop. Therefore, NineNeins is not limited to only those collaborators who use PhotoShop. This opens every avenue for all artists as it is not software specific.</p>
                        <h3>Blender</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Blender is also a free software that has made working on game content easier; especially with the bridges to move from application to application. This enables me to Photoshop in Blender (not the best for effects) and vice versa; and render out to (say Gimp) for another.</p>
                        <p>In general, these two do exactly what the Adobe products can do. They are also super lightweight and dont charge extortion fees which makes anyone who wants to collaborate on NineNeins welcomed.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Avid Protools is my default in the music department.</p>
                        <p>There are numerous alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Like Adobe and so many others, we see the Subscription and OS Limitation in full effect.</p>
                        <p>It seems the more creative software gets for artistry, the faster these cutoffs take place.</p>
                        <p>This industry of tech is quite different than most other sectors of tech and I think anyone in audio would agree.</p>
                        <p>I won't actully be covering the music side or softwares- nor alternatives (although some will be mentioned)- that is just rabbithole talk. Instead, I will demonstrate when to freeze your computer, why to rollback, and how to go legacy.</p>
                        <h3>Freeze IT</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Let us start with Protools; subscription based now ($30-$40/month).</p>
                        <p>This is a no-go no-brainer if you don't have a perpetual license already. Find one that does or go Open Sourced with <a class="pg" href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank">Ardour</a>.</p>
                        <p>Open sourced with technicalties such as a DAW are not so common.</p>
                        <p>There are a few other companies that are alternatives none the less. Find one that suits your needs and workflow.</p>
                        <p>Here's a list as a starting point- keep in mind each one can be used for anything you are doing- demo until you find one you like.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Avoid anything subscription based and check for "OS" limitations.</p>

                            <br>
                            <h3>OS Limitation- Most recent Win10/Win11</h3>
                            <br>

                            <p>All of these have shifted towards subscription with options/features- but all still offer a perpetual license only for the newer version. In reality, they do not offer a perpetual license.</p>
                            <p>The OS Limitation means it can not Roll Back. You are locked into their ecosystem- if you think well I just wont update- Microsoft will force your update as it does not need your approval, consent, or acknowledgement (see their terms of service).</p>
                            <p>Remember you are on their network, their system, their computer. You merely ask permission to access your payment plan. </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Moving onto the more niche areas in an attempt to breakdown a conversation that should be mainstream.</p>
                        <p>Although, like with Windows 7, I have never upgraded from AdobeCS6 once Adobe went Cloud based- I am no fan of Cloud based software.</p>
                        <p>Just as I never updated Avid Protools11 once they went Cloud based.</p>
                        <p>I personally, at that time of those transitions, went through a phase to begin removing big corporate products from my toolbox to get off and quit using Corporate software.</p>
                        <p>This is also a recommendation.</p>
                        <p>It is where my coding life and developing began.</p>
                        <p>I saw the writing on the wall; especially as I got into the world of tech, networking, coding, and software. I decided to start backing up my entire Platform.</p><br>
                        <h3>Backing Up</h3><br>
                        <p>I bought hard drives and formatted them. Then, I got flash drives for portability and repeated the process.</p>
                        <p>I moved on and broke down each Software to dedicated Flash Drives with all the required drivers (etc.) before moving to make dual copies of each to CDs and then duplicates.</p>
                        <p>Even investing in a separate tiny dedicated server to access via the network if I ever had need for it.</p><br>
                        <p>This may all seem overboard or crazy to many, but now with Win 10 all that redundant backing up has really paid off.</p>
                        <h3>Reinstall</h3>
                        <p>I had to update one of my main computers not too long ago- not a problem. Without the backups this would have been a nightmare and in some cases impossible. Instead, I had every boot option and installer option possible.</p>
                        <p>That will make more sense to AMD users. Even more sense to those who, like me, have an AMD machine (I prefer for Graphics) running Win 7.</p>
                        <h3>Setup Digression</h3>
                        <p>Intel for Audio and AMD for Graphics (noticeably better for graphics); although I can't really tell the difference unless doing any type of rendering. Other than: the audio drives are in one and the graphic drives are in the other- everything else is mirrored down to the hardware (graphics cards, ram, cooling, even the chassis) and networked. One is simply IntelBoard and I9 the other is AMDBoard and R9.</p>
                        <p>The only real difference is installing Win 7. Still quite minor but is different none the less.</p>
                        <h3>Who Cares?</h3>
                        <p>That should cover all the technicalties of what is and what is not possible. It also covers the evidence that Win 7 runs flawless on whatever your setup and what to expect.</p>
                        <h3>Purge</h3>
                        <p>Through out my purge of Corporate software and out of everything Adobe offers- only 2 Adobe softwares would remain and both by default.</p>
                        <p>Another Corporate software I use which is a non-Adobe product is (Avid) ProTools, along with those attached software (Imaged); also gone the Cloud nightmare route.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Disclosure- I chose these 3 addons out of my toolbox for name noriety and to demonstrate the bigger point.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>These programs only reinforce why I once harped on perpetual licenses. This is where Open Source becomes important and stands out.</p>
                        <p>Although I use Adobe, Avid, and a handful of others, this is only due to the fact that I OWN them and despite their horrid buisness models which justify pirating.</p>

                                        <h3>Pirating</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>When I say "pirating" is justified, it is. Notice how old this software is now. Yet, there have been no real advances in technology across the spectrum.</p>
                                        <p>Wherever there is open source, good business practice, and dedicated developers - you should always support them where you can.</p>
                                        <p>I practice what I preach, I own and recommended an assortment of different proprietary software, and believe one should invest in their gear. If you can't afford it: 99% of the time you dont need it.</p>
                                        <p>As for pirating (say Protools11), keep in mind this is a keyed and ilokd program— as all plugins are wax (64 Bit)— if you are determined to go find a pirated version for Protools you will notice you will need Protools10- as all plugins are TDM or RTAS (32 Bit) instead... and if you do go that route, you will still need to purchase an Ilok.</p>
                                        <p>This will never be worth the effort! The alternatives in the music section are WAY better options not just out of availability or to avoid these hassles, but they offer a lot more.</p>
                                        <p>But, if you decide to go ahead it is important to add the majority of all (Plugs/Addons) are still available for now. Just purchase and rollback for desired (Plugins/Addons).</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Addons/Plugins</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>With that said, many of the (Addons/Plugins) become the new hurdle; such as Waves(13) which for now - if I am not mistaken, still supports previous versions (9-12) with a perpetual license.</p>
                                        <p>So pirating is not quite as justified- yet. Eventually the only way to use these products will be by having to pirate- just so they run. Which, by that time is not really pirating, it is just archiving.</p>
                                        <p>The installer used, however, to install those previous versions must be rollbacked and THAT installer saved as a backup- as an OFFLINE install is required. A full back up (no matter how redundant) becomes crucial.</p>
                                        <p>Although the highest Version of Waves that you could use (on Win 7 for example) is Version 10, anything created after Version 10 will be unuseable. Anything before Waves 10 (which would be Version 9) will be fine.</p>
                                        <p>The only real difference between Waves 9 and Waves 10 are some bug fixes that were annoying.</p>
                                        <p>If you were to somehow unkey Protools11 to use Pirate Waves... it still wouldnt work (only 64 bit) because you would have to regress back to Protools 10 (which is also Ilok but 32 bit), but will run pirated Waves 9-10 (and you would have to find a legit copy of Protools 10 and purchase an Ilok).</p>
                                        <h3>Dead End</h3>
                                        <p>All in all, Protools is a dead end software and it is not even worth it if you don't already have a perpetual license (which is no longer available). The alternatives I recommended are on the table (just as good and in some cases slightly better). All empires run their course until their self destruction.</p>
                                        <h3>Support Developers</h3>
                                        <p>Supporting the alternatives shows a demand and a market that wants nothing to do with their subscription Microsoft corporate congress. Don't expect the corporate to care. Actual developers will step in- sort of like where the alternatives already have: understanding that marketshare.</p>
                                        <h3>Find a License</h3>
                                        <p>If you must have Protools (10-11) find a legit copy and purchase an Ilok. Version 11 is much more system friendly.</p>
                                        <h3>Really No Reason</h3>
                                        <p>There is really never a reason to pirate software unless its a hollywood production; then who cares? Stream the hell out of it.</p>
                                        <p>Unless you are trying to recover files...well then its really just archiving.</p>
                                        <h3>Its Not Complicated</h3>
                                        <p>Keep in mind this example applies across the entire tech spectrum; not just music software. This is just the most blatant; as with Adobe and nearly everything Microsoft, associates of Microsoft, etc. </p>
                                        <p>I am not against pirates as they are invaluable and are not even pirates anymore but simply archive enthusiasts, as far I am concerned.</p>

        <p class="tc">This is where we must take a step back and look at the elephant in the room. Protools 11 was released in 2013 and Adobe CS6 was released 2012.</p>
        <p class="tc">So what has changed with these programs since then?</p>
        <p class="tc">Considering it has been a decade- nothing! A theme we will see repeated.</p>

                        <h5>Important Components</h5>
                        <p>Ok, so you got the Daw (Software Program). Surely thats it right? Right? Nope.</p>
                        <p>Why do I bring these 3 into the mix?</p>
                        <p>These are softwares I also use and the reason they are presented here is due to this plague of subscription.</p>
                        <p>Audio is the easiest way to explain the importance of rollbacks, freezing your computer, and going legacy because they are softwares that depend on softwares of softwares with Names. This does pertain across the entire Tech Industry (Plugins, Dependencies, Extensions, Add-Ons) as we have seen with Adobe in this article; much like Microsoft Office or 365- etc.</p>
                            <p>Lets move on.</p>
                            <h3>Native Instruments</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p> Native Instruments (being first in this breakdown) has already begun rolling out their's starting at $10/month.</p>
                            <p>Expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. However, they have simultaneously started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                            <p>With OS Limitation you have to freeze their installer version. If you have a perpetual license then you can activate. However, you will not be a able to install their installer with the new installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                            <p>You must freeze the previous installer version. Interesting note: none of their products are dependent in anyway on Win 8-10 or 11. ONLY the installer is dependent on Win 10+. What sense does that make?</p>
                            <h3>Waves</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Waves is just like Native Instruments above and has begun rolling out their's starting at $8/month and as high as $20/month.</p>
                            <p>Identical to NI and expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. They have also started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                            <p>With their OS Limitation- anything new they make, you must have WIN 10+ to use- fine by me no temptation or care about anything else they make. I just saved 115% by switching to Windows 7.</p>
                            <p>Like NI above, 99.9% of everything they offer (180 tools/products) is not dependent on Win 8-10+. With the exception of 2 of their new products and also you guessed it... the Installer.</p>
                            <p>Do you see what is happening?</p>
                            <p>You have to freeze their installer also/and if you have a perpetual license, then you can activate. However, you will not be a able to install their installer with the newer installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                            <p>This marketing should become very obvious.</p>
                            <p>A product you can buy for a one time $40 License fee- will now cost you $10/month forever for a bundle that cost only $99 total.</p>
                            <h3>FabFilter</h3>
                            <p>Keeps it simple and basic and I love them for it. Not only are their products top notch favorites of mine but they show the OS limitation is a market ploy to force transitions and bring in the corporate subscription scam.</p>
                            <p>Why is it FabFilter is uneffected by all these tech changes? Maybe they actully care about their base... sounds like it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Lets Do Basic Math.</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Win 10= Subscription Based<br>
                                Let's say you want to make music (enter any product).<br>
                                <br>
                                (Main Software) Protools= 40 a month.<br>
                                (Instruments) NI= 10 a month<br>
                                (Digital Gear) Waves= lets go super cheap= 8 a month</p>
                            <p>That is $58 a month!</p>
                            <p>What do you get other than a monthly bill? Nothing!</p>
                            <p>Compare that to Waves which still does offer perpetual license ($99). Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that $8 subscription.</p>
                            <p>Or Native Instruments which still does offer perpetual license (Free-$99). Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that $10 subscription.</p>
                            <p>In the not so long ago we would call this a payment plan- only problem here is once you make the final payment you receive nothing but your next payment due statement.</p>
                            <p>When you look at software developments we will see a pattern. Let's use Waves again for instance... <br><br>
                                Since Version 9 (2012): Last massive update creating 64bit/AXX
                                <br>
                                Version 10: A reskin for 25year anniversry<br>
                                Version 11: to be compatible with Win 8 (Installer). Added 2 new plugins<br>
                                Version 12: to be compatible with Win 10 (Installer). Added Plugin Resize and other GUI reskin glitter, and useless gimmik plugins.<br>
                                Version 13 (2022): to be compatible with Win 11 and Apple (Installers).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Since V9 nothing has changed! Except Microsoft compatibility. Yet, with a subscription these nearly nonexistant change/updates you will be charged for.</p>
                            <p>The tiny bug fixes here and there after 10 are so numerous they would have to tell you what they fixed with a magnifying glass.</p>
                            <p>There is no reason to actully innovate when you have a constant forced subscription stream of money and Microsoft Corporate funding.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This demonstrates what you get for $969 a year.</p>
                            <p>3 forced OS updates, fancier gui, and apple= $2907 (OS Version Based) worth of Subscription on Basic Package.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The next slap in the face is V9 was released 2012... it is 2022! Thats 10 years!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>That means you will pay... wait for it... $9,690 for those $99 basic packages.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Just to really drive this point home, you could have bought and OWNED the entire Waves Library Bundle of all 180 Plugins, all of Fab Filter, everything NI offers, and any DAW of your choice with all the bells and whistles with hardware (comps,eqs,mixboard,mics,keyboard), instruments- you know an ACTUAL little REAL life recording music studio.</p>
                            <p>And still had $1200 in your pocket and 0 payments.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Instead, you get to choose between paying $10 forever for $99 product or $20 forever for a $199 product.</p>
                            <p>Now you will own nothing, make your monthly payment forever, and only ever receive the same $99-$199 product.</p>
                            <p>If you dont pay- they cut you off. This includes all your project files and your backups become completely dependent on your bank card.</p>
                            <p>Imagine purchasing a piano and you create a bunch of music- write your songs- you make your payments. Then one day, you say hold on a minute I bought this piano and the corporation says- "No more piano for you. You can never own the piano, you can only borrow it at a premium.".
                            </p>
                            <p>Your work, projects, and songs are now locked in the program unless you pay. You can not remove them from the software because they are locked by extension- you could copy all of it one by one, note by note, out of the program to paper or the like - but only after you pay.</p>
                            <p>This is what the Tech industry has done. This is what every corporate entity has ever done. Lease, debt, own nothing, pay forever, be happy.</p>
                            <p>This is the route all tech is inevitably going.</p>
                            <p>If you are using Windows 8-11- you are already in that ecosystem. If the Software Corporations want their grants, funding, and partnership to remain in online stores, advertise, or merely exist: then they will promote the Corporation of Microsoft and push Microsoft products (hence add blocks by installer).</p>
                            <p>As we see, all newer versions are simply blocked, they are not incompatible.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I know many will say "If you dont like it just change companies." Which is what I am advocating (FabFilter, Recomended Daws). It sounds good on paper but the reality is just ALL companies have or in the near future will adopt this route under Win 8-11 policy or else they will be blocked by Microsoft.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Open Source will not be fully immune- Microsoft owns Github.</p>
                            <p>The writing was on the walls years ago and today it is seen everywhere! Everything you do on YOUR Computer will cost $10 a month, at least! Any addons/plugins will cost extra. Anything you create will be reviewed ... all the while you are on a subscription based OS (Win 8-11) that can turn itself off, uninstall programs since it has full access, and shut down on you for whatever reason because you dont even own that or anything on it.</p>
                            <p>Why do you think all of Win 8-10 was free?<br>
                                Why do you think Win 11 is also free?</p>
                            <p>If you value any freedom you have to roll back and go Legacy.</p>

                        <p> This is my main setup without the tweaks and a fundamental break down of recommendations across many aspects. Of course all of this is not needed by most people. Take what you will from this quick write up and I hope it serves as some kind of guide.</p>
                        <p>There are many avenues to choose from and I attempted to cover as much as possible in the shortest time possible.</p>
                        <p>No matter your interest or field, the proper tools are essential. Whether beginner or pro, we are all always learning, always growing, always innovating, and always creating.</p>
