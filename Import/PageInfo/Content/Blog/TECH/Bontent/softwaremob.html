                            <h5>2 Min Read</h5>
                            <p>Open Source - Open Source is generally Free and the code is Public meaning you normally have full access to the programs code.</p>
                            <p>Licensing - When it comes to proprietary software meaning not Open Source such at Windows/Apple and big name brand Software/Services.</p>
                            <h5>Perpetual</h5>
                            <p>I personally do not lease software or do subscription unless it falls into specific niches such as Email/Vpn/Hosting and the likes, but: never general software where I must rationalize why I need a specific tool, program, at a cost/ratio... Where I purchase a perpetual license.</p>
                            <h5>Leasing</h5>
                            <p>Leasing is normally a perpetual license in many cases granting access to future updates(read the terms of software). Sometimes it is timebased again read the terms of software.</p>
                            <h5>Subscription</h5>
                            <p>This is 100% timebased</p>
                            <h5>Pros/Cons</h5>
                            <p>The pros and cons of my personal method(Perpetual/OpenSource) starting with the cons are as follows.</p>
                            <h5>Cons</h5>
                            <p>1. Locks one into a particular version.</p>
                            <p>2. Much more expensive upfront.</p>
                            <p>3. Updates and new future features will expire on release of the new version.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Pros</h5>
                            <p>1. Security</p>
                            <p>2. No Subscription</p>
                            <p>3. 3. Own your copy.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>These options will all depend on what you want to accomplish and your projects - not all are rational for everyone and will vary depending on ones particular needs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Cost</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>However, it is my preferred option and recommendation that if you use a software as a main tool - then support that organization.</p>
                            <p>Perpetual Licencing is fantastic for well-built Software as also for longevity and solid computer life.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Ratio</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>A prime example of this are Adobe Products: the only REAL difference between Adobe CS6 and The Newest Versions (CC:Creative Cloud) is the name, the Cloud, and now is ONLY Subscription Based.</p><br>
                            <p>Thanks to Perpetual Licencing which has kept me from having to deal with that nightmare.</p>
                            <p>Which means I have all the perks of Adobe without the forced Updates and without granting corporate Access to my devices to use Adobe Products, in which normally comes bundled with a ton of things you will never need or want turning solid somftware into simply Bloatware - in majority of cases you have to pay for all that bloat.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Not all updates are good, subscription makes you dependent,
                                Leasing software makes you completely at the mercy of corporations in may instances.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Do not be a Slave.</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I am all for supporting developments but there is a difference between supporting and being extorted.</p>
                            <p>Keep this in mind as your personal finances and choices of how you want to license is up to you completely - UNLESS Adobe, Microsoft, Avid, and many other Corporations say differently.</p>
                            <p>It is true when the option is available for say $50-$600 for a Perpetual License that sounds expensive.</p>
                            <p>Today most subscriptions start from $120 a year (Basic - $10 a month) to $953 a year (Pro- $80 a month).</p>
                            <p>I ask you now which one is cheaper?<br> Cost/Ratio= Perpetual everytime.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>But, If I had not had a Perpetual License before Adobe switched to "Cloud Subscription" 10 years ago - well, Multiply that by $120 for the basic packages(1/4 of what I own). Which is doubling the price - with a payment due next month.</p>
                            <p>Having a Perpetual License ends up being not only WAY cheaper but it also means I own it(Pro Package). Meaning Adobe can take that cloud nonsense elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>*Loads up PhotoShop CS6*</p>
                            <p>This is important to understand my recommendations, logic, Software and things to keep in mind.</p>
                            <h5>Alternatives</h5>
                            <p>There are alternatives that are just as good and sometimes even better coming in a range of Open Sourced and Proprietary.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Personal Example</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>Just recently I put off updating a Perpetual License for a software I own  (version 3) due to I did not realize the newest (version 5) release would happen to fall into the "OS Limitation" trap.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Many features I no longer have for that Software as I was rewinded back to my paid version with noway to update to the last working version (version 4).</p>
                            <p>I could update - but I would hit the OS Limitation meaning I must upgrade to Win10.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I will not do that: so the Software version I want for that program (version 4) is no longer available.</p>
                            <p>The worst part here is there is no alternative for that software. I simply took a gamble by passing up the $65 upgrade - and like most gambles the House won. Will get into this topic in "Legacy".</p>
                            <p>So keep this in mind when I recommend a Perpetual License - I am not trying to sale you something but there is very logical reasoning behind it.</p>
                            <p>If I had the option to upgrade to that software (version 4) again I would not think twice this go around - sometimes its better to be safe and not sorry.</p>

            <p>This is simply a highly requested topic and some of the most frequently asked questions with some explanation.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h4>Proton Mail/VPN</h4>
                            <br>
                            <p>Lets move on to Email which in this case doubles as a VPN : <br> I should probably say a VPN that doubles as an Email.
                            </p>
                            <p><a class="tc pg" href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> and <a class="tc pg" href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a>.</p>
                            <p>A company that everyone who values privacy knows and should use and support. All Proton features are encrypted and bundled so like google one account and everything syncs.</p>
                            <p>There is not to much to put here being its just an Email and a VPN which I have come to find out many do not have a VPN or use a VPN for what ever reason but def should.</p>
                            <p>As for what A VPN is and isnt is not something I will get into here.</p>
                            <p>I will instead say ProtonMail is a one of a kind being encrypted end-to-end.</p>
                            <p>If you value privacy and like many using gmail or others - then you do not value privacy since google employees and their affiliates, advertisers, corporations, friends, partners, agents, nsa, government, banks, anyone really - combs through your emails.</p>
                            <p>ProtonMails Encryption is End-to-End - meaning the only ones who can see your email messages are the sender and you the receiver, maybe you are the sender I don't know... but only the person you emailed can see it.</p>
                            <p>Why are you not using ProtonMail?</p>
                            <p>The VPN side of things becomes absolutley Free so if you were not using one for whatever reason you are now.</p>
                            <p>Protons services are unmatched. They honestly have 0 competition at this stage in the game.</p>
                            <p>In combination with Brave Browser you can actully feel the protection like a blanket. </p>
                            <p> Price range from Free and yes actully free including the VPN.</p> 
                            <p>Then you have paid plans $5 for Basic and $12 for Unlimited (which are extremely reasonable) for an even better experience. Especially on the VPN side of things not to mention these packages come with Bridge which we will get into in just a second.
                            </p>
                            <p>Compare that to Netflix starting at $10/Month and Amazon Prime at $15/Month for majority of individual households for some reason.</p>
                            <p>Where only Amazon makes any rational sense due to free shipping which pays for itself - the same can be said for ProtonMail/VPN.</p>
                            <p>Important to mention Brave also offers a VPN built into Brave. However, at the price point which is identical to ProtonVPN which has far more value bundled with Mail/Bridge. </p>
                            <p>There is quite no reason anyone should not make this subscription based.<br> It works on Mobile too!</p>

                                <p>Everything most have used google for and the reason many still do - <br> are the same exact same reasons that are also available from Proton with one simple account.</p>

                            <p>Bridge allows you to bring ProtonMail to the desktop using a client of ones choice. I happen to promote Thunderbird as a client for numerous reasonings: A quick summary is being Thunderbird is open source, highly customizable, and because I have used it forever which is integrity.</p>
                            <p>Drive is a cloud storage which allows you to have Cloud access.</p>
                            <p>Calendar... Well, it's a calendar and very helpful and much better than googles which adds fake holidays like sodomy month, juneteenth and black made-up belief month.
                                <br>Just a good, solidly built, clean calendar without globohomo political correctness shoved down your throat. </p>
                            <p>But also secure your data and schedule, events, appointments without the political correct google agents all in your business.</p>

                            <h4>CryptoWallets</h4>
                            <br>
                            <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWBraveMeta"></style>
                            <br>
                            <p>Now we get into the little more unfamiliar waters for the majority. If you took our recommendation for Brave then instantly you have already started this process, for a Crypto Wallet comes built directly into Brave Browser.</p>
                            <p>Although it is limited being Ethereum based — and using only Wyre — however alot can be achieved through the wallet and is fantastic especially if you are just getting started into the crypto world. This simply overall replaces MetaMask so there is no need for an extension.</p>
                            <p>These features are whole programs used daily which I feel are relevant enough to add them to the list</p>.
                            <h4><a href="https://uphold.com/signup?referral=aeb7fe32a1" target="_blank">Uphold :</a></h4>
                            <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWUpHold"></style><br>
                            <p>If you are really into crypto or want to get a real official Crypto Wallet.</p>
                            <p>We can do this once again directly from the Brave Browser and Link(in this case you would create an Uphold account.) This will actually require verifying (ID and typical Financial Information) for will be opening a Crypto Bank Account. I cover this topic in much more detail in "Crypto Talk".</p>
                            <p>Once Verified you will have access to the Entire Exchange which is very PayPalish feeling and allows to send and buy Crypto all on the Fly.</p>
                            <p>This is easiest format by far for those looking for a Crypto like PayPal exchange.</p>
                            <p>Which you can then sync to your Brave to receive your Brave Rewards and to tip and use however you like.</p>
                            <h5>Into the real world.</h5>
                            <p>Uphold also offers a debit card(like PayPal) so you can spend your crypto whenever and wherever - even out and about or to pay bills at no extra charge wherever Visa/Mastercard are accepted.</p>
                            <p>Keep in mind this is secure — however is very personal with your name attached no different than a debit card — this is not Crypto Anonnomity. See CryptoTalk for more on this. It only felt right to add these two to this list. Of course there are other Crypto alternatives, but for the mass this is the easiest and fastest ways to jump in.</p>
                            <h5>2FA</h5>
                            <p>Really this market is so small, but it is extremely useful as also is a destructive double edge sword. I do not recommend this unless absolutely necessary - but I do not advocate against 2FA due to I personally use it religiously.</p>
                            <p>My only recommendation is Authy</p>
                            <p>Did I mention this is all built into Brave... With Proton Suite to offer all the security and privacy one could want and more. Why are you using anything google?

            <h4>Final Brave Thoughts</h4>
            <br>
            <p>By now It should be clear how powerful and amazing the Brave Browser is as a whole. As I stated Brave/Proton will completely revolutionize your Browser experience.</p>
            <p>With all security built in, encryption, Search Engine, access Dapps, a Crypto Wallet - Link straight to Uphold, even Tor is built in and it works fantastically however is not an actual replacement of Tor... and even with all these features there is technically no Learning Curve.</p>
            <p>This is not to fanboy over Brave Browser. Brave Browser is simply hands down wonderful and easy all around. Which in my opinion is ultimately the best way to judge a program or software as also introduce the masses to Alternative Tech with practically 1 download, and just set up accounts they desire.</p>
            <p>In my experience everyone I have gotten on Brave/Proton/Uphold absolutely Love the setup - which opens the world of crypto to them without all the complications.</p>
            <p>Everything I recommend I actually stand behind, and this is hands down the best recommendation on this list for the 95%.</p><br>

                            <h5>Domains(DNS)</h5>
                            <p>I have to put my only recommendation for Domains and that is
                                <a class="pg" href="https://my.freenom.com/" target="_blank">Freenom</a> on this list. Truly amazing folks and fantastic all around. If you need a domain <a class="pg" href="https://my.freenom.com/" target="_blank">Freenom</a> is the absolute best! There is no alternative and no competition. So go support them!</p><br>
                            <h5>Hosting</h5>
                            <p> This is where things start getting sketchy and will solely depend on your content, skill, time, and dedication - specially if your content is as controversial or frowned upon as mine.</p>
                            <p>I am on the fringe in which free version of parent companies is my boundary paying for such services in my shoes is all a gamble - a gamble not worth putting money on the table - when they all force the current thing banners.</p>
                            <p>I suggest Hosting yourself with tools like Apachee for example - but that is a whole seperate adventure all by itself. I will not get into Server Niches here.</p>

                            <p><a class="pg" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudfare</a> is the recommended which needs no introduction. Will be best bet 95% of the time. This topic can be broken down into 30 different sections of tech babble - in which just use Cloudfare.</p>

                            <p> I am no fan of using CDN in such a fashion I prefer hardcode - in development this CDN method is the best workflow for obvious reasons.</p>

                                As we go further down the list some of the Software is Not-Free - perse. Some of them are not even available anymore in a giant sense : more on that in "Time to Stop Time".</p>
                            <p>Yet, there are fantastic alternatives to everything I personally use — however, I can not recommend all of them or all alternates — but ones I have used AND I feel are worth it I will mention. Most of the alternates I actually use in combination.</p>

Just facts of life — anything bloated and auto updates are not worth having — in fact many seem to agree with me in where I have had steady business reinstalling Win7 on others computers.</p>
                            <p>Of course this is not a requirement just a personal preference, more secure, better all around, and works flawlessly - which makes it a recommendation.</p>
                            <p>There are plenty of alternatives in the OS world excluding apple (Avoid like the plague.). Most notable are BSD and Linux which are alternatives - but I tend to avoid recommending them unless specific machining : which is just a super long digression I wont get into here.</p>

                                            <h4>Details</h4>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>Windows 7 is extremely stable, and everything runs on it. This is one of the greatest strengths of the many Win7s strengths.</p>
                                            <p>The weakness of Win7 is there are some caveats that need to be addressed and easily fixed - although not recommended if you dont know what you are doing.</p>
                                            <p>The main Caveats have to do with typical Microsoft spyware which is every Microsoft OS/programs problem. This is actually quite easy by simply not installing the final two updates at installation (for an easy fix).</p>
                                            <p>As there are a few others scattered abroad the installation such as Skype and most attached to such programs.</p>
                                            <p>This really is not an OS problem but a default programs problem.</p>
                                            <p>Next will be dealing with bloat (in which only matters) if you even know what I am talking about. If you do then do your thing. If not then it has really no relevance to you. However, the bloat is where other undesirables are hidden.</p>
                                            <p>Lastly, Simply activate by whichever method you prefer whether toolkit or serial. And done.</p>
                                            <p>Congrats on your freedom with Win7. Now many will claim it is better to use something other than Win7 because of the steps I laid out - as also that somehow the myth Alts are safer.</p>
                                            <p>This is the key: the moment you connect to the internet every computer enters the very same threat level. If that is the concern, simply do not connect to the internet.</p>
                                            <p>Remove all wireless hardware capabilities, Bluetooth, Wifi, etc.
Such as I have no Wifi for my computers (although both boards are capable of it) - they are run Ethernet. This is important to say and harp on due to No OS comes with Switch hardware - just saying.</p>
                                            <p>Of course this setup is not feasable for everyone. Specially those on laptops unless they remove their wifi chip - which sort of renders a laptop mostly useless. I have a Laptop that does run Wifi and it has a purpose in the "Network".</p>
                                            <p>I digress to demonstrate the moment any OS/Computer connects to the internet you therefore open a port. This has nothing to do with Win7 or any other OS.</p>
                                            <p>Unlike Win8-11/Apple there is no software for auto updates to control, scan, update, access, control, verify, etc. on Win7. (This was included in the final RollUp update of Win7.)</p><br>
                                            <p>This is the whole reason why everyone should dump Win8-11 and avoid as stated earlier the last two updates for Win7.</p>
                                            <p>Win7 is just as safe (To be even safer make changes to your network settings.) as any Alternative which I also advocate — however unlike the other alternatives which have their place and purpose — only on Win7 is everything compatible, everything installs, everything just works.</p>
                                            <p>I happen to personally run software that no other OS can accommodate — As this list is really just common tools and nothing special as most of it is quite mainstream — many things are mainstream for a reason. That becomes another of Win7s ultimate strengths.</p>
                                            <p>Here we simply took the Mainstream Offline and turned it into an Alternative.</p>
                                            <p>This is one of the biggest improvements one can accomplish with general ease.</p>

                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> , by now I dont think needs an introduction.</p>
                            <p>The only real alternative to
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> would be
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a> in which is an Open Source and I personally use <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a> side by side with
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> due to CCleaner is an absolutley wonderful development.</p>
                            <p>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> is an optional Freemium option (if you desire) - this option can come to an end or "OS" incompatible if you run older OS.</p>
                            <p>The take away thing here is CCleaner is not expensive at all specially for what it does and everything it does.</p>
                            <p>As CCleaner has not blocked OS by installer - let me pin a "yet" here.</p>
                            <p>The CCleaner Perpetual License is also still an option where I would recommend Pro+ at around $50 (version).<br>
                            I will get more into this in Legacy.</p>
                            <p>But, it is a tool that is possible of going full-Adobe and becoming unusable without a subscription.</p>
                            <p>Like many software that are blocking by installer and all seem to be already compatible with Win11...
                            <br><br>CCleaner has not added Win11 to their site "yet" - in which that is a possible connection — and a possible factor to consider — creating the highly plausible fact they may block by installer and most likely will offer legacy options for those with a Perpetual License.<br><br>In which may or may not - be purchasable afterwards.</p>
                            <p>With that out of the way, CCleaner is a truly phenomenal piece of software that will not require all the updates that comes with the Lease-Perpetual License - for these particular software are tuned to the computers OS preferences. That is critical to understand and keep in mind!!!</p>
                            <p>Meaning, even when your version expires either Update License or by OS... the License simply covers the "Download" and subscription to Updates for that Version, not the program itself.</p>
                            <p>Essentially — it is a one time purchase that does not require the License to run therefore acting more as an Open Source donation — rather than a Corporate Software.</p>
                            <p>So why bother with <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/" target="_blank">BleachBit</a>?</p>
                            <p>Now we look to <a class="pg" href="https://www.bleachbit.org/">BleachBit</a> being an Open Source does not have the license/download dilemma - as also has the possible particular OS limitations that would require version rollback. Although extremely unlikely.</p> 
                                <p>Being an Open Source: The OS limitation is not a problem... if for any strange reason it had ever been a problem due to not limited by corporate pressure or any reason to bend to Microsoft or any others will.</p>
                            <p>BleachBit also far surpasses CCleaner in many regards specially when we get into File Deletion as the name may suggest "BleachBit." Although CCleaner does surpass BleachBit in Scan and across the functionality spectrum since CCleaner is a Suite not a Single function hence also its name "C(omputer) Cleaner" just as BleachBit. </p>
                            <p>Which helps to really differ the two programs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Things Considered</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>I like having a double checker with programs like these: specially two I respect, trust, and like. These two really do compliment one another and are two different tools for two different purposes.</p>
                            <p>This purely becomes a personnel preference - one... or in this case two - I decided were worth.</p>

                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>?</p>
                            <p>A simpler question would be - what
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> is not...</p>
                            <p>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> is not really an IDE perse.</p>
                            <p>But it is easy with the use of Packages and the entire Github, NPM, PIP, etc libraries to turn it essentially into an IDE.</p>
                            <p>he possibilities are quite endless, and it is in reality merely just a text editor (an extremely integrated Notepad).</p>
                            <p>As far as recommendations go and software I use - this is by far my most used piece of Software!</p>
                            <p>Do you have to have SubLimeText?</p>
                            <p>Absolutely Not! Is just my recommendation no matter your project, complexity, size, and goals. <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> is hands down my favorite and go to. </p>
                            <p>If the price is out of the budget for whatever reason - you can always just run with the trial for ever.</p>
                            <p>As for other IDEs/TextEditors — I must be honest I have been using <a class="pg" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">SublimeText</a> since its release — and never really bothered with IDEs after that.</p>
                            <p>Most IDES are Syntax specific - So there is that bottleneck in certain instances. As for text editors I can only speak on comparable to SublimeText.</p>

                            <p>Where Notepad++ and Atom which are both Free would be alternatives.</p>
                            <p>You may hear some complain if I don't mention the "visual studio": which is also free. So let me mention it quickly.</p>
                            <p>Visual studio is a typical microsoft bloated, clunky, and very slow compared to SublimeText and both of the two alternatives.</p>
                            <p>Again, Notepad++ (which is also microsoft) and Atom, which are both Free and much better alternatives.</p>
                            <p>I would use Atom over Notepad++ if those were my choices. Due to the fact Atom is much more like SublimeText in many ways and its not microsoft - sort of.</p>
                            <p>This is just another one of those "sometimes a small pricetag is just worth it" to me.</p>

                                <h3>Convertors</h3>
                                <p>This is a very large topic. Here are the top three I use and why.</p>
                                <h3>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://file-converter.org/" target="_blank">File Converter</a></h3> 
                                <p>When you deal with audio files or want an audio clip from a video, or possibly just to change quick video format on the fly.</p>
                                <p>This is where File Converter truly shines.</p>
                                <p>With its simple context menu straight from the folder.</p>
                                <h3>
                                <a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a></h3> 
                                <p>Created by WonderShare in which offers many products (like Adobe) but only 1 of softwares do I personally use and recommend - although their marketing campaigns are dodgy. They have an extremely solid product and by far my favorite in this aspect of things. (This one I do have an affiliate for.)</p>
                                <p> 
                                <a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a> covers many aspects in their toolbox from TvCast, metadata fixer, and a screen recorder as bonuses.</p>
                                <p>Their download and convert is tremendous. Unlike File Convertor above UniConvert covers everything File Convertor does not and is not open source nor free like File Convertor. </p> 
                                <p>UniConvert is $80(perpetual version license) - I started using this product quite a long way back, and have never looked back since. This of course is if you are constantly converting in which sometimes thats all I feel like I do.</p>
                                <p>There are many alternatives that are very similiar - almost same exact developer similar - same code similiar in many cases.</p>
                                <p>So why UniConvert? UniConvert is the only one I know that allows downloading straight from within the program from say bitchute/youtube/etc straight into conversion, clip, or audio.</p>
                                <p>UniConvert and File Conversion together is the ultimate combination.</p>
                                <p>The final piece to this little Trilogy is another software I Use constantly and also recommend.</p>
                                <h3><a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a>.</h3>
                                <p> Which is a fantasitic powerful software. Although, I do not use handbrake for Conversions very often in reality at all - that is not really where <a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> shines. Handbrakes compression is hands down untouchable. This software in invaluable when it comes to compression. <br><br> Hence,<a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> can do so much more than just compress as it can double as an alternative to UniConvert or File Converter if you really wanted it to.</p>

                                <h3>All Working Together.</h3>
                                <p>It is important to note that I do use "Adobe Bridge" for everything project - which is really just a fancy folder structure.</p> 
                                <p>So to illustrate this process... <br><a class="pg" href="https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/" target="_blank">UniConvert</a> I use to BringIn(DL)/Convert/Format/and Organize Folder Content.</p>
                                <p>File Convertor if looking to cut audio for audio editing and or on the fly of already downloaded files.</p>
                                <p>
                                Where I use Adobe Bridge for those files in the System. 
                                <br><br>
                                Then on Render - <a class="pg" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a> compresses all video on the output. <br>
                                Images go through Photoshop(TinyPng Plugin).<br>
                                Audio renders from Protools - mp3 being the compressed.

                        <p>This has been a back and fourth challenge. <br><br>
                            As of now there is a version for GoDot, Unity, Defold, and Renpy.</p>
                        <style class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechSW swt-TechSWRenpy"></style>
                        <p>Renpy has become the story Line and what I would call the Blueprint Engine. Truely revolutionary in many ways, and is capable of so much more than what I currently use it for. Renpy has become one of my favorite Engines to work in without a doubt.</p>

                        <p>Unity and GoDot have become my jump betweens. NineNeins will most likely end up on 1 of these 2 Engines. As of now I would say GoDot is the way I lean more towards.</p>

                        <p>Both Adobe programs can easily be replaced with a number of other softwares. Such as <a class="pg" href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, and <a class="pg" href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> being my recommended Alternatives.</p>
                        <p> Both are free alternatives in which Both I also Use and Love due to their portabilty and lightweight.</p>
                        <p> So why keep Photoshop and Aftereffects?</p>
                        <p> This has to do with the Bridge between all the different aspects of Video Game Design, plus industry standard which makes cross platforming collaboration with other creators much simplier, and also because Photoshop is still my default Image processor and default for Projects.</p>
                        <p>After Effects I use just for that "Effects"</p>
                        <p>So why still use Gimp and Blender?</p>
                        <h3>Gimp</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Gimp is free and much more suitable for mobile and allows collaborations with anyone who does not have Photoshop. Therefore NineNeins is not limited to only those who use PhotoShop. Which opens every avenue for all artist, and not software specific.</p>
                        <h3>Blender</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>As Blender is again a Free software that has become much easier in working on Game Content specially with the bridges to move application to application. Allowing me to Photoshop in Blender(not the best for effects however), and vice versa, and render out to say Gimp for another.</p>
                        <p>In general there is nothing these 2 can not do in reality - that the Adobe products cannot. As they are also super lightweight and dont charge extortion fees which make anyone who wants to collab on NineNeins welcomed.</p>

                        <p>Avid Protools is my default on the Music side of things.</p>
                        <p>There are numerous alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Like Adobe and so many we see the Subscription and OS Limitation in full effect.</p>
                        <p>It seems the more creative software gets for artistry the faster these cutoffs take place.</p>
                        <p>This industry of tech is quite different than most sectors of tech and I think anyone in audio would agree.</p>
                        <p>Here I wont actully be covering the music side or softwares - nor alternatives although some will be mentioned - that is just rabbithole talk. Well it sort of use to be.</p>
                        <p>Instead will demonstrate when to freeze your computer, why to rollback, and how to go legacy. </p>
                        <h3>Freeze IT</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lets Start with Protools which is subscription based now($30-$40 a month).</p>
                        <p>This is a no-go nobrainer if you dont have a perpetual license already : find one that does or go Open Sourced with <a class="pg" href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank">Ardour</a>.</p>
                        <p>Open sourced with technicalties such as a DAW are not so common.</p>
                        <p>There are a few other companies that are alternatives none the less. Find one that suits your needs and workflow.</p>
                        <p>Heres a list as a starting point - keep in mind each one can be used for anything you are doing - demo until you find one you like.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Avoid anything subscription based and check for "OS" limitations.</p>

                            <p>The OS Limitation means it can not Roll Back. You are locked into their ecosystem - if you think well I just wont update - Microsoft will force your update as it does not need your approval, consent, or acknowledgement(see their terms of service).</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Moving into the more Niche side of things to attempt to breakdown a conversation that should be mainstream.</p>
                        <p>Although, like Windows 7 I have never upgraded from AdobeCS6 once Adobe went Cloud based - I am no fan of Cloud based Software.</p>
                        <p>Just as I never updated Avid Protools11 once they too also went Cloud based - I am repeating myself.</p>
                        <p>I personally at that time of those transitions went through a phase to begin removing big corporate products from my toolbox to get off and quit using Corporate softwares.</p>
                        <p>This is also a recommendation.</p><br>
                        <p>This is actully where my Codeing Life and Developing begun.</p>
                        <p>I saw the writing on the wall specially as I got into the world of tech, networking, codeing, and softwares and I decided to start backing up my entire Platform.</p><br>
                        <h3>Backing Up</h3><br>
                        <p>I bought hardrives and formatted them, I then got flashdrives for portabilty and repeated the process.</p>
                        <p>I moved on and broke down each Software to dedicated Flash Drives with all the required drivers(etc), before moving to make dual copies of each to CDs then duplicates.</p>
                        <p>Even investing in a seperate tiny dedicated server to access via network had ever needed it.</p><br>
                        <p>This may all seem overboard or crazy to many, but now with Win10 all that redundancy backing up has really paid off.</p>
                        <p>I had to update one of my main computers not to long ago - not a problem. Without the backups this would have been a nightmare and in some cases impossible, instead I had every boot option and installer option possible.</p>
                        <p>That will make more sense to AMD users.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Checkmate</p>
                        <h3>Lets Software</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Through out that purge of Corporate software and of everything Adobe offers - only 2 Adobe softwares would remain and both my default.</p>
                        <p>Another Corporate software I use which is a non-Adobe product is (Avid)ProTools and those attached softwares(Imaged) - which has also gone the Cloud nightmare route.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Disclosure - I chose these 3 addons out of my toolbox for name noriety and to demonstrate a bigger point.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>These programs only reinforce why I had once harped on Perpetual Licenses. This is where Open Source becomes Important and really shines.</p>
                        <p>Although I use Adobe, Avid, and a handful of others this is only due to the fact that I OWN them and despite their horrid buisness models which justify pirating</p>

                                        <h3>Pirateing</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>When I say pirating is justified it is. However, Notice how old this software is now. Yet, there have been no real advances in technology across the spectrum.</p>
                                        <p>Wherever there is open source, good buisness practice, and dedicated developers - you should always support them where you can.</p>
                                        <p>As for pirating say Protools11 keep in mind this is a keyed and ilokd program - as all plugins are aax - if you are determined to go find a pirated version for Protools you will notice you will need Protools10(for all the other Pirated Software) instead... and if you do go that route you will need to purchase an Ilok.</p>
                                        <p>This will never be worth the effort - the alternatives in the Music section are WAY better options not just out of availabilty, nor to avoid the hassle, but they offer alot more.</p>
                                        <p>But, if you for some reason decide to go that route it is important to add the majority of all (plugs/addons) are still available for now. Just purchase and rollback for (Plugs/Addons).</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Waves</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>With that said many of the (addons/plugins) become the new hurdle : such as Waves(13) which for now - if I am not mistaken in fact still support previous versions(9-12) with a Perpetual License.</p>
                                        <p>So Pirateing is not quite as justified - yet. But eventually the only way to use these products will be by having to pirate - just so that they simply run. Which at that time is not really pirateing its just archiving.</p>
                                        <p>The installer however to install those previous versions must be rollbacked and THAT installer saved as a backup - as an OFFLINE install is required. A full back up no matter how redundant becomes crucial.</p>
                                        <p>Although the highest Version of Waves that you could use(on Win7 for example) is Version 10. Anything Created after Version10 will be unuseable - anything before Waves10 which would be Version9 will be fine.</p>
                                        <p>The only real difference between Waves9 and Waves10 are some bug fixes that were annoying.</p>
                                        <p>If you were to somehow unkey Protools 11 to use Pirate Waves... it still wouldnt work - you would have to regress back to Protools10(which is also Ilok) but will run pirated Waves9-10 - but you would have to find a legit copy of Protools10 and purchase an Ilok.</p>
                                        <p>All in all Protools is a dead end software and it is not even worth it if you dont already have a Perpetual License(which is no longer available) - when the alternatives I recommended are on the table(and just as good and in some cases slightly better) - all empires officially run their course until their self destruction.</p>
                                        <p>Supporting the alternatives shows a demand and a market that wants nothing to do with their subscription microsoft corporate congress. Dont expect the corporate to care - but actual developers will step in - sort of like where the alternatives already have : understanding that marketshare.</p>
                                        <p>There is really never a reason to pirate software unless its a hollywood production then who cares. Unless you are trying to recover files well then its really just archiving.</p>
                                        <p>Keep in mind this example applies across the entire tech spectrum not just Music software. This is just the most blatant as with Adobe, Nearly everything Microsoft, associates of Microsoft, etc. </p>
                                        <p>I am not against pirates they are invaluable and are not even pirates anymore but simply archive enthusiast as far I am concerned.</p>
                                        <br>

                        <p> This is where we must take a step back and look at the elephant in the room. Protools11 was released in 2013 and Adobe CS6 was released 2012.</p>
                        <p>So what has changed with these programs since then?</p>
                        <p>Considering its been a Decade - Nothing! Again, as we will see.</p>

                        <p>Ok so you got the Daw(Software Program) surely thats it right? Right? Nope.</p>
                        <p>Why do I bring these 3 into the mix?</p>
                        <p>These are SoftWares I also use and the reason they are presented here is due to this plague of subscription.</p>
                        <p>Audio is the easiest way to explain the importance of rollbacks, freezing your computer, and going legacy because they are Softwares that Depend on Softwares of Softwares with Names. This does pertain across the entire Tech Industry(Plugins, Dependencies, Extensions, Add-Ons) as we have seen with Adobe in this article. Much like  MicrosoftOffice or 365 - etc.</p>
                            <p>Lets move on.</p>
                            <h3>Native Instruments</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p> Native Instruments being first in this breakdown has already begun rolling out theirs starting at $10 a month</p>
                            <p>Expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. However, they have also at the same time started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                            <p>With OS Limitation you have to Freeze their installer version and if you have a Perpetual License then you can activate. However, you will not beable to install their installer with the Newer Installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                            <p>You must Freeze the previous Installer version. Interesting Note : is none of their products are dependent in anyway on Win8-10 or 11. ONLY the installer is dependent on Win10+. What sense does that make?</p>
                            <h3>Waves</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Waves is just like Native Instruments above and has begun rolling out theirs starting at $8 a month and so far up to $20 a month.</p>
                            <p>Identical to NI above and expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. They have also at the same time started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                            <p>With their OS Limitation - anything new they make you must have WIN10+ to use - fine by me no temptation or care about anything else they make. I just saved 115% by switching to Windows7.</p>
                            <p>Like NI above 99.9% of everything they offer(180 tools/products) is not dependent what so ever on Win8-10+. Except 2 of their new products and also you guessed it... the Installer.</p>
                            <p>Do you see what is happening?</p>
                            <p>You have to Freeze their installer also and if you have a Perpetual License then you can activate. However, you will not beable to install their installer with the Newer Installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                            <p>This marketing should become very obvious.</p>
                            <p>A product you can buy for one time $40 License - will now cost you $10 a month forever for a Bundle that cost only $99 total.</p>
                            <h3>FabFilter</h3>
                            <p>Keeps it simple and basic and I love them for it. Not only are their products top notch favorites of mine but they show the OS limitation is a market ploy to force transitions and bring in the corporate subscription scam.</p>
                            <p>Why is it FabFilter is uneffected by all these tech changes? Maybe they actully care about their base... sounds like it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Lets Do Basic Math.</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>Win10 = Subscription Based<br>
                                Lets say you want to make music(enter any product).<br>
                                <br>
                                (Main Software)Protools = 40 a month.<br>
                                (Instruments)NI = 10 a month<br>
                                (Digital Gear)Waves = lets go super cheap = 8 a month</p>
                            <p>That is $58 a month</p>
                            <p>What do you get other than a monthly bill? Nothing!</p>
                            <p>Compare that to Waves which still does offer Perpetual License($99) Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that $8 subscription.</p>
                            <p>Or Native Instruments which still does offer Perpetual License(Free-$99) Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that subscription of $10 subscription.</p>
                            <p>In the not so long ago we would call this a payment plan - only problem here is once you make the final payment you receive nothing but your next payment due statement.</p>
                            <p>When you look at software developments we will see a pattern. Lets use Waves again for instance... <br><br>
                                Since Version 9(2012) : Last massive update creating 64bit/AXX
                                <br>
                                Version 10 : A reskin for 25year anniversry<br>
                                Version 11 : to be compatible with Win8(Installer). Added 2 new plugins<br>
                                Version 12 : to be compatible with Win10(Installer). Added Plugin Resize and other GUI reskin glitter, and useless gimmik plugins.<br>
                                Version 13(2022) : to be compatible with Win11 and Apple(Installers).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Since V9 nothing has changed! Except Microsoft Compadibilty. Yet, with a subscription these nearly nonexistant change/updates you will be charged for.</p>
                            <p>The tiny bug fixes here and there after 10 are so numerous they would have to tell you what they fixed with a magnifying glass.</p>
                            <p>There is no reason to actully innovate when you have a constant forced subscription stream of money and Microsoft Corporate funding.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This demonstrates What you get for $969 a year.</p>
                            <p>3 forced OS updates, fancier gui, and apple = $2907(OS Version Based) worth of Subscription on Basic Package.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The next slap in the face REALITY is V9 was released 2012... it is 2022! Thats 10 years!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>That means you will pay... wait for it... $9,690 for those $99 basic packages.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Just to really drive this point home you could have Bought and OWNED the Entire Waves Library Bundle of all 180 Plugins, All of Fab Filter, Everything NI Offers, and any DAW of your choice with all the bells and whistles with Hardware(comps,eqs,mixboard,mics,keyboard), Instruments - you know an ACTUAL little REAL Life recording music studio.</p>
                            <p>And still had $1200 in your pocket and 0 Payments.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Instead you get to choose between paying $10 forever for $99 product or $20 forever for a $199 product.</p>
                            <p>Now you will own nothing, make your monthly payment forever, and only ever receive the same $99-$199 product.</p>
                            <p>If you dont pay - they cut you off. This includes also all your project files and your backups become completley dependent on your bank card.</p>
                            <p>Imagine purchasing a Piano and you create a bunch of music - write your songs - you make your payments then one day you say hold on a minute I bought this Piano and the corporation says - nomore Piano for you. You can never own the Piano you can only borrow it at a premium.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your work, projects, and songs are now locked in the program unless you pay, you can not remove them from the software because they are locked by extension - you could copy all of it one by one, note by note, out of the program to paper or the like - but only after you pay.</p>
                            <p>This is what the Tech industry has done. This is what every Corporate entity has ever done. Lease, debt, own nothing, pay forever, be happy.</p>
                            <p>This is the route all tech inevitably is also going.</p>
                            <p>If you are using Windows 8-11 - you are already in that ecosystem - if the Software Corporations want their grants, funding, and partnership to remain in online stores, advertise, or merely exist : then they will promote the Corporation of Microsoft - and push Microsofts product hence add blocks by Installer.</p>
                            <p>Which as we see all newer versions are simply blocked they are not incompadiable.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>As I know many will say if you dont like it just change companies in which is what I am advocating(FabFilter, Recomended Daws) - but also which sounds good on paper but the reality just as I am demonstrating here is ALL companies have or in the near future will adopt this route under Win8-11 policy - as shown above or else they will be blocked by Microsoft.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Open Source will not be fully immune - Microsoft owns Github.</p>
                            <p>The writing was on the walls years ago and today it is seen everywhere - Everything you do on YOUR Computer will cost $10 a month at least, any addons/plugins will cost extra, anything you create will be reviewed all while you are on a Subscription Based OS(Win8-11) that can turn itself off, uninstall programs since it has full access, and shut down on you for whatever reason because you dont even own that or anything on it.</p>
                            <p>Why do you think all of Win8-10 was free?<br>
                                Why do you think Win11 is also free?</p>
                            <p>If you value any freedom you have to roll back and go Legacy.</p>

                        <p> This is my main setup without the tweaks and a fundamental break down of recommendations across many aspects. Of course all of this is not needed by most. Take what you will from this quick write up and I hope it serves as some kind of guide.</p>
                        <p>There are many avenues to choose from and I attempted to cover as much as possible in the shortest time possible.</p>
                        <p>No matter your interest or field the proper tools are essential. Whether beginner or pro we are all always learning, always growing, always innovating, and always creating.</p>
