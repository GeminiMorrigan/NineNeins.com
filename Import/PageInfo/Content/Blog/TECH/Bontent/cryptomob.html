            <p class="bh">Why all this Crypto talk?</p>
            <p> 
                NineNeins is banned from using a payment processor. All developments require funding and NineNeins is not immune. Crypto is our only option- a concept that NineNeins has been experimenting with for a very long time. NineNeins had to learn the ins and outs of Crypto; a process that was also unfunded.
                <br class="r"><br />

                All of this just to start raising the funds neccesary! An obstacle our competitors have never had to overcome. Sheer dedication and commitment to our development got us through the worst of times.
                <br class="r"><br />

                So, here we are! We finally have a type of bank for finances that is integrated into our network. It is safe, secure, and user-friendly. We can now compete!
            </p>
        <div id="Anonymity"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Anonymity Exhausted</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                Anonymity is a process within the tech world that is quite challenging. Even more so when it comes to Crypto. Crypto is not as "crypto" as many believe. This is a hurdle that I have been working on for months.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Crypto is one of the very few tools I have at my disposal to fund the development. Unfortunately, that anonymity comes with a very high price tag. The use of Hot Wallets burns through the funds to the point where Crypto is no longer viable.
                <br class="r"><br />

                In a development such as NineNeins, the current HotWallet becomes absolutely worthless after all of the gas/transaction fees (which are SUPER expensive). The only way to resolve this is to use a central wallet and this comes with the flaw of verification.
                <br class="r"><br />

                As it stands, there is no other option I have come across after months of researching and trying to formulate ways around it. It is possible if P2P. This method is too overbearing in maintenence, complicated for the general public, and is even more strict in execution/options. P2P is a great solution in theory only.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Which leaves a few possible options and one solid option...verification.
                <br> I know. I know. Undesirable! The financial world is, well, the financial world. Keep in mind these are only options- not requirements!</p>
        <div id="Transparency"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Which brings us to Transparency</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                <strong>Security</strong>- NineNeins has 0 trackers, 0 ads (although we do have a few affilates; they are only linked, not injected), 0 fingerprints, and HTTPS connections. </br> I am not in any way, shape, or form trying to collect anyone's information.
                <br class="r"><br />

                We are not gathering lists of players, users, and/or members. We have done everything possible to avoid information collection. It has been quite a nightmare, if I'm being honest. Not even attempting to collect a single cookie, which makes using some features damn near impossible and extremley tricky.
                <br> We opted to change the typical cookie notice. You are, instead, greeted with a reminder about the importance of using a VPN. If you don't have one, we offer options for a VPN (which we are not compensated for)... and NORD-mie is not one of those options!
                <br class="r"><br />

                Meanwhile, using HotWallets will remain an option for those that prefer such a method and who don't care about fees. PSA: Continuing to only offer HotWallets is an early grave for NineNeins. That is just the hard facts of reality.
                <br> For those that already participate in exchanges or those new to Crypto, there will be new options that won't cost a fortune to use. They are simple and an outright blessing. Before we jump into that, one thing must be addressed.
                <br class="r"><br />

                A HardWallet is always recommended when Crypto is in play. Whether you play, contribute, use NineNeins, or not... Take the same precautions that you would with anything financial. This includes your seeds, passwords, and 2FA(s). You are warned ahead of time for the worst-case scenario.
            </p>
        <div id="Uphold"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Uphold</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                Uphold is the recommended option which becomes super easy to incorporate with the Download of Brave which is the recommended Browser of NineNeins. Uphold is Practically built in.
                <br class="r"><br />

                This will allow our development and players 0 transaction fees whilst also allow BAT to be used for the NineNein Reward system and available game asset. This also helps us support Organizations such as Brave in which we are avid advocates of.
                <br> The Uphold platform is the best option but keep in mind Uphold like all financials will require a verification process.
                <br> This verification process is the sole reason we never advocated Uphold before. Personally being an avid User and Advocate of Brave since its inception with NineNeins also being a Brave Verified Site. We have decided after all this time to confidentially advocate Uphold.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Uphold is a legit Payment Processor and Exchange. It is truly a Paypal alternative that has proven itself to be advocated by NineNeins. I personally really do regret doubting Uphold over the years. It was really just the Verification aspect that ever really kept me from making it a pillar in our development.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Disclosure - Over time it has become extremley obvious and super common for this Verification process. It took a long time obviously for me to accept that. Coming to terms with it was simply realizing it is no different than opening a bank account, getting a drivers license, etc.
                <br> I know many will suggest I go with Binance - but the truth is Binance is uhmazing for what Binance was designed for - which is Investing. Uphold however is far superior when it comes to the Marketplace - Uphold is truly the Paypal of Crypto.
            </p>
        <div id="Membership"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Membership</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                NineNeins DOES NOT and WILL NOT offer autopay nor subscriptions in the traditional format. For both autopay & subscriptions would require the collection of User Information such as Email, Names, etc.
                <br class="r"><br />

                NineNeins will however be adding an option for Sign in thru a Minds/Gab/Uphold account. These options open an avenue to use Minds Token instead of a direct exchange or a HotWallet - adding CoinBase(Verification) and WalletConnect(Compatibles) as further options by default for those those that still want to use a HotWallet(WalletConnect) at lower fees.
                <br class="r"><br />

                MetaMask is also a Minds option but MetaMask can also be used without a Minds account on NineNeins.com. So two cheers for MetaMask! Minds will offer a great way to stay connected via Social Media, Groups, quick Community Support, and offer NineNeins a simple alternative to offer so many different options and opportunity to everyone.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Gab is also another option and will reflect more accuratly of the community. Minds only wins out due to offering an exchange and buisness wise and like an Uphold alternative. Although Gab wins out where community, groups, and support are concerned.                
                <br class="r"><br />

                Finally, there is sign in with Uphold which of course was covered above. 
            </p>
        <div id="Oppurtunity"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Oppurtunity</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                NineNeins contribs, players, and users will all benefit in free In-Game assets such as BAT and Minds Tokens to raise their Powerlevel and support NineNeins.
                <br> By simply participating in Brave Rewards(BAT) and upgrading your Minds to a plus account to accumulate tokens from your post.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Imagine supporting NineNeins by simply surfing the web as usual and sharing & posting on social media about whatever you want, love, and desire.
                <br> Uh-mazin
                <br class="r"><br />

                Yet this is just another option to fund and support NineNeins which is nearly 100% free and requires 0 verification.
                <br> Minds does require a plus account which is $5 a month which comes with all the other perks of Minds.
                <br class="r"><br />

                As on the flip side Braves amazing browser and potential are fully taken advantage of. I think NineNeins may be one of the first... possibly only... to implement it in such a way... I may be wrong... if so I stand corrected... if I am not wrong then thats awesome innovation.
                <br> As for Minds with the atheistically pleasing, easy to use layout and Free Speech Advocacy can be fully used to its full potential to support Content Creators such as NineNeins.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Everybody wins!!!
                <br> Individuals have ways to support NineNeins while getting the best Browser available a Social Media that wont censor them and instead crowd funds their users. Not to mention ways to contribute to Pro-White content creators.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Frens at Brave, Uphold, and Minds get their products highlighted and used as they are intended to be used with a new user base that raises OUR marketshare.
                <br> NineNeins creates a niche for Market and Social which makes developments like NineNeins Possible.
                <br class="r"><br />

                There simply is not more that needs to be said at this point.
                A rising tide lifts all boats.

        <div id="SumItUp"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Sum It Up</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p class="h4 tc">
                Options are all we are providing along with the pros and cons of each.</p>
                <br>
            <p>
                If you wish to remain 100% anonymous - use Hot Wallet for the premium. </p>
            <p class="bh">
                This is not recommended for small transfers. Ecominacally retarded.<br> 20 dollars to send 20 dollars = 40 dollars. </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                If you want free transaction fees and simplicity - Uphold is the way to do it.
            </p>
            <p class="bh">
                This will require identification verification.</p>
                <br>
            <p>
                If you desire a platform with social usability - Minds is the choice.</p>
            <p class="bh">
                Offers many options for Crypto but many limitations on verification, MetaMask does not require Minds. </p>
            <p><br>
                Maybe, a combo of the options? 
                <br class="r"><br />
                Finally, the most prefered way is joining NineNeins with Brave by using (BAT) and joining Gab.<br> 
                However, as the NineNeins motto states - "Its all up to you."
                <br>
                <br> We are more than a Game we are a Development. At least you can rest assured none of your information is stored on our servers, none of this information is collected by NineNeins, none of this information is filed or listed in any NineNeins database, and every option is YOUR choice.
                <br class="r"><br /> 
                This is by far the best option to keep anonymity while at the same time granting NineNeins a solid platform to grow upon.</p> 
        <div id="CryptoView"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>CryptoView</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
            Crypto is an expansive world. Here we will breakdown the accepted Cryptos used at NineNeins and why. As well as throw some transparency on our portfolio as to how NineNeins uses Crypto on the backend. Each Coin listed here is accepted by NineNeins. 
            <br class="r"><br />

            Each coin has its specific place & utility in NineNeins. 
            Each offers every Crypto option widely available whether Vet or New to the Crypto world. Whatever your preference, wallet, or coin we technically accomodate since all of them are interchangeable.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-content">
            <h3>Monero</h3> <p>The overall preferred Crypto of the NineNeins development. We use Monero for 90% of the storage and transactions of our portfolio. When it comes to Crypto - Monero is the Posterchild of what Crypto is and should be. The downside of Monero is useage in Common Marketplace. Despite the Marketplace flaw - Monero is still NineNeins preferred option and recommendation.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>BAT</h3> <p>Is a Crypto that makes mass integration simple for the NineNeins Development. Due to this it became a Favorite of NineNeins. With an easy asset to market, built in easy setup wallet, and Reward program. Which was a <strong>perfect</strong> for NineNeins. The simplicity and integration makes the utility Token the #1 preferred option for NineNeins.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ethereum</h3> <p>The Crypto of Dapps. Ethereum is special in the Aspect of Technological usage. This makes connectivity and useing as a marketplace asset invaluable. Ethereum is more aimed at audiences not on the Brave Platform thanks to developments such as MetaMask.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>DogeCoin</h3><p> Our attention quickly fell on DOGE which we had already been collecting due to the sheer cost (below a penny) and Meme Nature which would fit our theme phenomenally making DOGE an absolute favorite - before its rise. After the surge of DogeCoin our initial investment helped pay expenses and now sits at a perfect cost coin for NineNeins. Was just meant to be as DOGE saved our development.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bitcoin</h3> <p>The Industry Standard meaning the most popular. BitCoin is also the gateway for many into Alt-Utility Coins - so by default it makes no sense for NineNeins not to incorporate. Bitcoin is our most least used option - its value is just impractical for the use of a market. Trying to figure 0.0002 to the masses is just not reasonable.</p>
        <div id="Portfolio"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Portfolio</h4> 
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
            As for quick paragraph explanations of Cryptos we have in our investment portfolio and why. Also will explain why they are not accepted by NineNeins for In-Game content - but for Contribs they are perfectly fine for they make up large portions of our portfolio. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-content">
            <h3 id="Dashcoin">DashCoin</h3><p> A Coin we first looked at during our development. The reason we did not adopt it was due to privacy issues for OUR development. Dashcoin was still a coin we got behind due to its Paypalish feel, design, and useage. The potential is just phenomenal. We chose Ethereum over Dash due to its useabilty and integration - also Ethereum is much more private.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="Cardano">Cardano</h3> <p>Is a Coin we look at as more of an investment than usage. Is easier to view Cardano(Security), Dash(Paypal), and Ethereum(Dapp) as parts of each other. Making Cardano more porfolio worthy than a NineNeins In-Game asset.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="XRP">XRP</h3><p> Is a Coin which centers on transfering. This was probably the most suggested coin to use for the NineNeins development. However, we did not due to XRP(s) lack of proof of work and security for OUR development. Meanwhile, XRP has a rightful place in our portfolio.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="BI">DigiByte & Atom</h3><p> Are Coins that focus of Blockchain Infrastructure. Obviously, neither are what one would consider currencies. Portfolio worthy absolutley.</p> 
        <div id="EndGame"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>Endgame</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
                The Engame is merely options. These options are not grifts or panhandlin' as many will most likely claim - even tho using any of them to support NineNeins is solely if you use the infrastructure to support NineNeins. These options are merely to provide a financial backing to NineNeins development by employing Alt-Tech infrastructure. What a horrible grift wouldnt you say?
                <br class="r"><br />

                We at NineNeins simply can not go down to the local synagogue... I mean bank... and get the financing for our project - we can not do as everyone else and simply use basic Payment Processors such as Stripe or PayPal or simply load a widget.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Even our Hosting(Site) & Platform(Game) cant simply just be hosted nor platformed. Each require intricate innovating alone. Much like these options here being heavily weighed to an outcome of practical solutions.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Nothing we do is simple and almost always requires jumping into steep learning curve aspects to acheive one thing.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Without Finances nothing is possible. Equipment, Artist, Developers, Licensing, etc. require funds. These options presented are just that... options. Practical and Usable Options
                <br class="r"><br />

                NineNeins will still be FREE to play and everything at Nine-Neins will always remain 100% free. This is not about mammon to us, it is just the very basic functions of reality. The In-game market and contrib funding are the only aspects to keep NineNeins going, growing, and evolving and will inevitably rely solely on these options provided here.
                <br class="r"><br />

                Fund what you like and support - or else it goes away... just as true as the 14 Words.
            </p>
        <div id="CryptoMiracle"></div>
        </section>
        <h4>DOGE Miracle</h4>
        <section class="b-content">
            <p>
            So this is the reason for all the Crypto talk. Without Crypto NineNeins would have been dead in the water a few years ago ; and in fact NineNeins was for quite awhile. Doge helped change that and has sparked real life back into NineNeins.
            <br class="r"><br />

            For that we are forever grateful. We are still here because of our Faith, Dedication, Thought Out Investments, Commitment, Crypto, a little Luck, and your support and love through Contribs that support Pro-Whites. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-content">
            <p> 
                We have spent the time researching, so you don't have to. We have spent just as much time trying to implement it(still in the process) to make it as secure, easy, and enjoyable as possible. This is the buffet of options to choose from. This is simply by far the best way forward. As will put our development way ahead of the curb in the future being pioneers in still a niche that is still in its infancy.
