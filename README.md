:Changes-CURRENT
The Original Design was planned and become Deprecated due to this project got far to large, far to fast. 
The Main Changes is mostly Links.

9Neins.Ga will still serve as a SubDomain. However, changing Platforms on the new system for the Blog itself, will determine whether the Blog will stay as 9Neins.Ga, or change to NineNeins.Com/Blog. There are Pros and Cons with each.

However, Play9NeinsOnline is completley Deprecated. Is is now NineNeins.Com/NN-Online. The orginal description is still in play to a large degree excluding these changes.
