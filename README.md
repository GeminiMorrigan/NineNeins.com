In this era of censorship. 9Neins has been thrown through the ringer which has slowed our development down, and to the point at times not moving at all. Those who deserve a Massive Thank You are companies who without- and are NOT actual contributors to the 9Neins Project nor development - but deserve recognition on our web presence without a doubt.
