Changes-(Update)
The Original Design was planned and was so successful it has become Deprecated due to this project got far to large (Over Exceeded by a Large Margin), far to fast. 
The Main Changes are mostly Links, Domains, Host, and another with a Blog Software Change.

``9Neins.Ga will still serve as a SubDomain. However, changing Platforms on the new system for the Blog itself, will determine whether the Blog will stay as 9Neins.Ga,`` or change to NineNeins.Com/Blog . ``There are Pros and Cons with each.``

Internet Archive has been removed 100% from Nine-Neins - has become unreliable. 

Also, Play9NeinsOnline is completley Deprecated. Is is now NineNeins.Com/NN-Online. 
DarkMode(Beta) has been Launched, MetaBrave is Active, NN-Online is running, and A complete Blog Switch is coming.

In this era of censorship. 9Neins has been thrown through the ringer which has slowed our development down, and to the point at times not moving at all. Those who deserve a Massive Thank You are companies who without- and are NOT actual contributors to the 9Neins Project nor development - but deserve recognition on our web presence without a doubt.
