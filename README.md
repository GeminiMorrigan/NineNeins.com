:Changes-(Update)
The Original Design was planned and was so successful it has become Deprecated due to this project got far to large (Over Exceeded by a Large Margin), far to fast. 
The Main Changes is mostly Links, Domains, Host, and another with a Blog Software Change.

9Neins.Ga will still serve as a SubDomain. However, changing Platforms on the new system for the Blog itself, will determine whether the Blog will stay as 9Neins.Ga, or change to NineNeins.Com/Blog . There are Pros and Cons with each. 

However, Play9NeinsOnline is completley Deprecated. Is is now NineNeins.Com/NN-Online. DarkMode(Beta) has been Launched, MetaBrave/Active NN-Online/and A complete Blog Switch will be included in the 0.8 Release. By 0.9 release after everything Is in motion, a Mobile Section will be added. Upon Release will become NineNeins.com 1.0.
